<p>In business, you make fine-grained adjustments all the time, in order to stay ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>Software tends to be rigid and hard to change.</p>
<p>Domain-Driven Design tackles this paradox, and considers software a living thing - just like your business.</p>
<p>By making the implicit concepts from your business explicit, DDD will give your software the ability to keep up with the agility that your business requires.</p>

2013 has been a good year; migrating my blog [from blogengine to a more up-to-date blogging platform](/posts/blogging-less-is-more-and-my-name-is-my-brand//) nearly doubled my visitors in the second half of the year, although it might have been the content as well.

I have to say that migrating to Jekyll somewhat helped in my engagement to blogging; I particularly enjoy the Markdown language aspect of it.

So, without much ado, here are the most popular posts from 2013:

1. [How to hire a senior developer](/posts/how-to-hire-a-senior-developer//)
2. [The 5 simple rules of software development](/posts/the-5-simple-rules-of-software-development//)
3. (In Dutch)[De voedselzandloper: zin en onzin](/posts/de-voedselzandloper-zin-en-onzin//)

Since my third one is in Dutch, I'll add the next post as well:
[Fallacies of the tech recruitment process](/posts/fallacies-of-the-tech-recruitment-process//).

Thank you all for a splendid year, and if you are from the neighbourhood and have nothing to do tonight: please come to Herzele - de markt: we treden daar elk jaar 1 keer op met een bandje dat nooit repeteert - dus vooral ambiance  gegarandeerd!!!
Ik vertrek trouwens binnen een paar minuten naar daar!

Best wishes!

Tom

<p>
Here at core, I use several freeware/open source tools and resources to make my life easier, and best of all, they are all free to use... A line-up : 
</p>
<h4>Sauce Reader</h4>
<p>
This is currently (according to my opinion) simply the best RSS-reader available.<br />
It is simple and works as expected with support for ATOM/RSS/RSS2.<br />
If you need to track a lot of websites for updates, this is one of the most time saving assets you can have at this moment.<br />

<h4>DasBlog</h4>
<p>
The blogging engine I am currently using (you are probably looking at it right now). Very versatile and easy to setup. <br />

<h4>Smart FTP</h4>
<p>
Simply the best FTP-client you can get <br />

<h4>Werkzeug1</h4>

Demo tool for creating top of the notch graphical presentations. Quite complicated, but also very powerful. I need some more time to dive in to this... <br />

# About me

My parents bought their first computer - a [TRS-80 Model III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80) - when I was about 8 years old. I found a book in English about programming, and it got me hooked for life. I graduated in 1998 as a bachelor in IT. 

In 2003, while working as an IT manager in a financial services organization, I decided to switch careers and engage as an IT consultant. I have been consulting ever since.

## My forte

Over a decade of consulting helped me to identify what I do best: 

<blockquote>
 <h3>Fit-gap analysis:</h3>
 I convert <b>your challenge</b> - i.e. "what keeps you awake at night?" - into an <b>actionable plan</b>.
 </blockquote>

This challenge can be anything, but my best work involves IT/business/supplier/customer alignment.

I commit to tangible deliverables with discrete timelines. 

## Challenges

Due to my background in [EA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_architecture)/[DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), organizations usually hire me for strategic projects. Some of their challenges:
 
 - Lack of trust between business and IT;
 - Our IT landscape is fragmented and/or outdated;
 - "Is (hyped) tech X something I should look in to?", f.e. blockchain, machine learning, virtuaal reality, ...
 - Lack of maturity in IT service/software development;
 - Projects going off-track for non-technical reasons.

## My clients

Over the years, I helped organizations to:
 
 - Build an IT roadmap starting from their vision/mission;
 - Productize a service (portfolio) by turning it into a solution (portfolio);
 - Pragmatically adapt enterprise architecture, providing value from the start;
 - Design product/service/software solutions.

My clients where mostly large/corporate/governmental organizations in sectors like finance/energy (trading)/Aviation/IT services/..., although I have experience with some start-ups and high-end consultants as well.

As am the founder and owner of [Virtual Sales Lab](https://virtualsaleslab.com), so I know how you run a business.

My hands-on software background is mostly in Azure/C#, TypeScript, Vue, but I also have experience with Erlang, Elixir, Haskell and many more.

You can see some of my refences on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomjanssens/).

Kind regards,

Tom

My parents bought their first computer - a [TRS-80 Model III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80) - when I was about 8 years old. I found a book about programming in [basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC), and it got me hooked for life. I graduated in 1998 as a bachelor in IT. 

In 2003, while working as an IT manager in a financial services organization, I decided to switch careers and engage as an IT consultant. I have been consulting ever since.

I was heavily involved in the start of the European [domain-driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) community, as I was the instigator of the [IDDD-tour in Europe in 2013](/posts/idddtour-2013-belgium-an-immersive-experience/), and I helped to boot [several DDD communities in Europe](/posts/an-update/).

In 2014 I founded [Virtual Sales Lab](https://www.virtualsaleslab.com/?lang=en), a SaaS platform for online 3D configurators, so I know how you run a business from experience.

My hands-on software background is mostly in Azure/C#, TypeScript, Vue, but I also have experience with Erlang, Elixir, Haskell and many more.

## Let's connect

I am always open to extending my network; feel free to connect.

Kind regards,

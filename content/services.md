# Get better at building software

    Get better at building software. <br/>
    Use tomorrow's techniques today.<br/>
    Not satisfied? Get your money back!
</div>

## How

In **sessions that take less than a day**, I teach you and your team **unconventional techniques that work**.

- **[the LIA protocol](#LIA)**: Enable your team to **identify and take ownership of issues**.
- **[Event- and model storming](#EventAndModelStorming)**: help your team to **unify business and software development**.

These sessions are distilled from:

- **Over a decade of experience** in building software, managing teams, being hired as the "problem-fixer".
- Experimentation **all over Europe**, f.e. in Belgium, the UK, France, Croatia, ... .
- A **pleathora of background knowledge**, including sales psychology, visualisation techniques and NLP to name a few.
- **Discussions with thought leaders and users** of these techniques.

## Why me? Why these techniques?

While I cannot predict the future, I assume that **it is very likely these techniques will go mainstream in the future**.

I have **solid track record** when it comes to **picking emerging tech**: over the last decade I have been using a lot of emerging tech and blogged about it; here's an excerpt:

- TDD / BDD / DDD
- CQRS / Event sourcing
- Functional programming
- Dependent typing
- F# / Fsharp
- Erlang
- Haskell 
- Idris
- ...

If you want more info about me or **verify my references**, please check my ["About me"](/about) page.

Introduce me and my services to someone who might benefit from it, and if it all works out you receive a 20% commission.

## The "Lean Issue Analysis" protocol

**Identify and take ownership of issues.**

### What

LIA is a protocol I **derived from the [proven lean coffee protocol](http://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/)**.
It will **enable** you and your team members to **discuss issues** in a **respectful, productive and efficient** way.

It shows you how to invest time in **the things that matter**, and **stop wasting valuable time** on discussions that are going nowhere or issues that are irrelevant.

By the end of this session, you and your team will have **a protocol** in place that will enable you **to handle issues more efficient**.

A typical LIA session should take about half an hour to an hour.

### How does it work?

Using the LIA protocol will enable you to:

- **Identify issues** that need to be resolved.
- **Take ownership** for an issue.
- **Respect** each other.
- Work **together**.
- **Agree to disagree**.
- Figure out **what works and doesn't work**.

## Event - and model storming

**Unify business and software development.**

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="nl"><p>.<a href="https://twitter.com/JefClaes">@JefClaes</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ToJans">@ToJans</a> are doing a great job on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TGGcon?src=hash">#TGGcon</a> workshop Event storming, the atmosphere is really great! :) <a href="http://t.co/MiDUMqXY7h">pic.twitter.com/MiDUMqXY7h</a></p>&mdash; The Geek Gathering (@Geek_Gathering) <a href="https://twitter.com/Geek_Gathering/status/464318677916319744">8 mei 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

During this session you will learn to **reduce the gap between business and software development**. You will also see how we can make sure **your software reflects the way your business works**.

### Event storming

This session starts off with **event storming**, a technique invented by [Avanscoperta](http://www.avanscoperta.it/en/)'s [Alberto Brandolini](http://ziobrando.blogspot.be/).

Event storming will:

- Enable you to subdivide your organisation into **different parts**, refferred to as **"bounded contexts"**.
- Help you to **identify** in which **"bounded contexts"** you might want **to invest in**.
- **Architect your software implementation** according to these "bounded contexts".
- Provide a simple way to **represent your organisation's workflow**, so that **both business people and software developers can understand** it.
- **Reduce the language barrier** that typically exists between software and business people.
- Figure out **potential areas where you can improve** your process by using software.
- **Visualize misunderstandings, disagreements and potential gaps** in your process.

A typical event storming session should take about one to two hours.

### Model storming

**Model storming** shows you how to **approach** a smaller part of your organisation **from different angles by using different models** to represent problems and solutions.

This approach typically helps you to:

- **Expose conflicts**.
- **Resolve issues** where you have a conflict.
- **Pinpoint** something that feels wrong.
- Find **alternative solutions**.
- Figure out ways to **improve usability**.
- **Find** paths that might offer you **a competetive advantage**.

A typical model storming session should take about one to two hours.

Over a decade of consulting helped me to identify what I do best: 

<blockquote>
 <h3>Fit-gap analysis:</h3>
 I convert <b>your challenge</b> - i.e. "what keeps you awake at night?" - into an <b>actionable plan</b>.
 </blockquote>

This challenge can be anything, but my best work involves IT/business/supplier/customer alignment.

I commit to tangible deliverables with discrete timelines. 

## Challenges

Due to my background in [EA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_architecture)/[DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), organizations usually hire me for strategic engagements. Some of their challenges:
 
 - Lack of trust between business and IT;
 - Our IT landscape is fragmented and/or outdated;
 - "Is (hyped) tech X something I should look in to?", f.e. blockchain, machine learning, virtual reality, ...
 - Lack of maturity in IT service/software development;
 - Projects going off-track for non-technical reasons.

## Outcomes

Over the years, I helped organizations to:
 
 - Build an IT roadmap starting from their vision/mission;
 - Productize a service (portfolio) by turning it into a solution (portfolio);
 - Pragmatically adapt enterprise architecture, providing value from the start;
 - Design product/service/software solutions.

## Clients

My clients where mostly large/corporate/governmental organizations in sectors like finance/energy (trading)/Aviation/IT services/..., although I have experience with some start-ups and high-end consultants as well.

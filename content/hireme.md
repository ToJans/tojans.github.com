Are you looking for someone to:

- Tackle a software/legacy project that nobody wants to touch? 
- Build a small product you want to be developed from start to finish?

**I'm your man and [I have a ton of references to prove it](/about/#toc_1).**

# Legacy projects

I untangle complicated projects using both conventional (f.e. [DDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)) and non-conventional 
(f.e. [event-storming](http://ziobrando.blogspot.be/2013/11/introducing-event-storming.html))  techniques.

(I am one of the founders of [DDD Belgium](domaindriven.be) and have been involved in the event-storming from the very beginning.)

I figure out where the boundaries in your software are, and how you can close the gap between business and IT.

**I can help you to untangle entangled software.**

# Product development from start to finish

As a former IT manager and someone who is building his own product from scratch, I can help you with all the steps required to build an actual product.

Disclaimer: I am currently in the process of launching my own product, but need to bridge a cash-flow gap. The advantage: I know what you are talking about!

**Get a product up and running without too much hassle.**

# My approach

A use an independent, pragmatic, bottom-up approach, in several phases:

- **The assessment:** I study the problem/project and propose some paths we can follow to handle it. (1-5 days) 
- **The execution:** We tackle the problem/project. I work bottom-up and give weekly progress reports to you. (1 to 6 months) 
- **The recap:** We look at the final progress we have made, lessons learned and what might be some potential opportunities to explore next.  (1-5 days)

# My background:

As for software development, I have a background in TDD, BDD, DDD, CQRS, C#, F#, Erlang and a bit of Haskell.

During my career as an employee, I have been both a software developer, a project manager, an Oracle DBA as an IT manager. 

After employment I've handled a ton of different [projects](http://be.linkedin.com/in/tomjanssens#background-projects), published on [a pleathora of subjects](http://be.linkedin.com/in/tomjanssens#background-publications).

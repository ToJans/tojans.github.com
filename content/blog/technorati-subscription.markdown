<p>
In order to increase my blog visibility I have subscribed myself to Technorati.&nbsp;In order to claim this blog I had to create an article with a link to my&nbsp;<a rel="me" href="http://technorati.com/claim/84sb36mry">Technorati Profile</a>&nbsp;.
</p>
<p>
I am hoping to&nbsp;post to this blog on&nbsp;more regular intervals.
</p>
<p>
In order to get you started I will&nbsp;provide you a link to <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/articles/list_articles.asp?userid=616289">some of my articles on codeproject</a>. Enjoy&nbsp;!

---

<p>
I have a new version of the intelligent keyboard for Windows Mobile 5/6 available. In this version, I use a smaller dictionary (15000 english words), and I have improved the performance as well. 
</p>
<p>
Currently the demo application supports :<br />
- AZERTY, QWERTY &amp; Number keyboard layouts<br />
- tactile feedback (a sound gets played each time you press a button)<br />
- intelligent word prediction (the words get chosen based on the position of the letters on the keyboard, so while you press &#39;I&#39;, the keyboard will also consider other letters like &#39;UOJKL&#39;, but they get a lower ranking. 
</p>
<p>
In order to use it you need to have windows mobile 5 or 6, together with the .net compact framework version 2.0 installed. Simply unzip the zip file, and start the &#39;coreinput.exe&#39; on your PDA. 
</p>
<p>
Please let me know what you think about this, by providing comments. It seems like over a hundred people have downloaded it, but so far I only got&nbsp;3 reactions from users <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=317962">on this forum</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Future improvements :<br />
- Better performance<br />
- Skinning support<br />
- Integrating the contact&#39;s names in the dictionary, as well as other custom words.

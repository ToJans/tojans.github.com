title: New google service - predict your search requests
---

<p>
In it&#39;s ever-continuing quest of improving their search engine, google is trying out a new concept : Google auto-suggest. As you type in your search words, google tries to predict them... <br />
<br />
In internet explorer (or mozilla, or almost any browser for that mather) you have an auto complete function : as you type in words, the program looks if you have previously entered any terms starting with the same letters. If you have, it shows them in a list, so you can simply select them instead of re-typing them. 
</p>
<p>
Google had this feature already, but now it has&nbsp;advanced even further in this : it tries to predict your search terms, and shows the number of results you get with a certain term in the list. Please note that&nbsp;this is currently in an experimental phase, so there still might be some minor bugs etc...<br />
<br />
Try it <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&amp;hl=en">here</a>.

# Hello,

Welcome to my blog. My name is Tom. 

This blog is a random collection of opinionated blurbs, mostly driven by my learnings and insights. It should by no means be considered as the absolute thruth, but more as an exploration of ideas and opinons.

Exposing my thought process might help you in some posts, but my target audience is someone like myself; I write to self-reflect and gain more insights from your feedback.

I am always open to extending my network; feel free to contact me.

Happy reading,

Tom

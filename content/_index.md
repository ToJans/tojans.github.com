# Hello,

Welcome to my blog. My name is Tom. 

This blog is a collection of random opinionated blurbs, mostly driven by my learnings and insights. It should by no means be considered as the absolute thruth, but more as an exploration of [ideas](/posts/cqrs-and-functional-programming/) and opinions.

Exposing my thought process might help you in some ways, but I mostly write to self-reflect and gain more insights from your feedback.

I am always open to extending my network; feel free to connect.

Happy reading,

Tom

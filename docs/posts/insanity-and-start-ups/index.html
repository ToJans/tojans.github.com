            <p>VCs are looking for start-ups who outperform their competitors not by a ten-fold, but at least a hundred- or a thousand-fold.</p>
<p>It is hard to predict which companies will evolve in this way, but one thing is well-known: your company will have to be fundamentally different than everyone else&rsquo;s in order to reach such ratios.</p>
<h1 id="key-differences-in-succesful-start-ups">Key differences in succesful start-ups</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spend time beating on a wall, hoping to transform it into a door.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Coco Chanel</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to outperform your competitors by such numbers, your company will need at least one of the following things:</p>
<h2 id="first-mover-advantage">First-mover advantage</h2>
<p>The first-mover advantage (a.k.a. technological leadership) is a well known concept that can be applied to almost everything:</p>
<p>When you are the first one to do something, you have a monopoly-like status on the market, which comes with all the advantages a monopoly gives (i.e. huge profite margins, exclusivity, effortlessly growing user base&hellip;).</p>
<p>As others notice your new market, they try to enter it, but usually as a first-mover you have already built a well-known brand and a huge technological lead over future competitors, which makes it hard for them to enter the market.</p>
<p>Typical examples of these companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Railroads</li>
<li>Energy providers</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vastly-better-implementation-than-everyone-else">Vastly better implementation than everyone else</h2>
<p>Sometimes markets exists, and a lot of people try to monetize the market, but nobody seems to do this exceptionally well.</p>
<p>All of a sudden an organisation emerges that does the same other organisations do, but better by at least a ten-fold, if not a hundred- or a thousand-fold.</p>
<p>You succeed when you are mentioned as a noun or a verb in the (urban) dictionary to describe the concept. (Referred to in Latin as &ldquo;pars pro toto&rdquo;.)</p>
<p>Typical examples of these companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google</li>
<li>Dropbox</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="marketing-and-branding">Marketing and branding</h2>
<p>A lot - if not most - of the B2C products have better odds of success based on the size of market share they have.</p>
<p>Once your user base outgrows the competition&rsquo;s user base by a ten-fold or more, the odds of you surviving and becoming succesfull grow big-time.</p>
<p>Sometimes people refer to this as &ldquo;growth hacking&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is one of the more popular things in start-up-consultancy, as the knowledge for these techniques is easy to productize.</p>
<p>In my opinion this is one of the more dangerous investements for a VC to make, because growth is not fundamental. It might be similar to and M.D. taking away the symptoms, but not the cause of the symptoms.</p>
<p>As this is artifical growth, market share usually drops vastly the minute a better alternative arrives.</p>
<p>IMO A lot of VC money gets burned by land-grabbing.</p>
<p>Examples of successful companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coca-cola</li>
<li>Pampers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="extremely-different-resource-allocation">Extremely different resource allocation</h2>
<p>This currently the bee&rsquo;s knees in start-up land: organisations that find or allocate resources in such a different way, that they manage to do the same thing as their competitors, but for a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>The most popular examples even manage to allocate other peoples' assets or time as their own.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uber</li>
<li>AirBnB</li>
<li>WhatsApp</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-is-this-related-to-start-ups--insanity">How is this related to start-ups &amp; insanity?</h1>
<p>A lot of the successful start-ups have at least one of these advantages, and the most succesful have all of them.</p>
<p>But, the way they became like that, is by doing their own thing, and not by listening to others.</p>
<p>In order for a start-up to be successful, it has to be different from the other 99% of start-ups. That&rsquo;s where insanity comes in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Albert Einstein</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to succeed, you need to be different.</p>
<h2 id="dont-believe-the-hype---_public-enemy_">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe the hype&rdquo; - <em>Public Enemy</em></h2>
<p>In times of gold-digger madness, the organisations that have the best profit/risk ratio are the ones that provide shovels and tools, not the ones who actually dig for gold.</p>
<p>I had the same ethical question as a software-/product consultant as well: &ldquo;if I know so well how to build a product, than why am I not building a product myself?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So I decided to put my money where my mouth was, and <a href="/blog/2015/03/06/Building-your-own-product/">I did</a>.</p>
<h2 id="correlation-does-not-imply-causation">Correlation does not imply causation</h2>
<p>The thing is: just because someone else was (moderately) successful with a strategy, does not imply that it might work for you. Different contexts might result in different results, and two contexts are never the same.</p>
<p>This is why in DDD newsgroups (or during our DDDBE meetings), when the question comes &ldquo;how do I do this&rdquo;, the answer is usually: &ldquo;Well, it depends&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Just because things work in one context, does not imply that they will work in yours. You don&rsquo;t get better than others by doing the same thing they do.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-is-your-point-exactly">So what is your point exactly?</h2>
<p>I love the fact that a start-up scene is sharing their experiences with everyone, and I am a big believer of the sharing economy.</p>
<p>After all, knowledge has become a commodity, and we should take the full advantage of that.</p>
<p>However, I would be wary of any &ldquo;this is the way you should do it&rdquo; advice, as in most cases you will not outperform your competitors by doing the same thing others do.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t copy their stories, but use them as a source for inspiration.</p>
<h3 id="edit">EDIT</h3>
<p>Or, as Yves put it:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="nl"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/ToJans">@ToJans</a> ok if I sum some of this up as &quot;Ask for experience not advice&quot; ?</p>&mdash; ylorph (@ylorph) <a href="https://twitter.com/ylorph/status/596232226813116416">7 mei 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<h1 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h1>
<p>The start-up scene is there, and it&rsquo;s alive and kicking.</p>
<p>However, I wouldn&rsquo;t get to much involved, as you might end up investing all your time in yak-shaving as opposed to building your product and market share.</p>
<p>While you can spend a lot of time in start-up scene, don&rsquo;t forget why you are there: to build a product.</p>
<p>And now, back to building my product!</p>
<p>Signing off,</p>
<p>T.</p>

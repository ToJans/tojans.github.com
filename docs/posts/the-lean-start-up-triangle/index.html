<h1 id="catch-22">Catch-22</h1>
<p>The basic lean start-up diagram looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.snag.gy/xg4LB.jpg" alt="Build-measure-learn triangle"></p>
<p>A while a go, <a href="http://tojans.me/blog/2012/02/28/project-%23startup10-learning-to-build-your-own-business/">when I decided to do 10 start-ups</a> 
the process usually was like this (simplification):</p>
<ul>
<li>brainstorm with another person on a start-up ideas</li>
<li>pick the best one</li>
<li>build a fake landing page</li>
<li>measure market fit (i.e. visitors/virality)</li>
<li>if NOK goto start</li>
<li>implement it</li>
<li>measure it</li>
<li>adjust it</li>
<li>repeat ad infinitum</li>
</ul>
<p>So, it looked a bit like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.snag.gy/nUUr7.jpg" alt="Build-measure-learn for idea, market &amp; product"></p>
<p>None of these were a success, and all of them have been shut down.</p>
<h1 id="fast-forward-to-my-current-start-up">Fast-forward to my current start-up</h1>
<p>I never stopped thinking about start-ups, and had several ideas over the following years. Every time I had an idea, I tried to figure out an 
elevator pitch, and a complete story about it. I would then go around and talk to almost everybody about it using this story. If they were interested,
I would tell them more and more and more. When we finally came to the price, I would ask them if they would pay for it. Most of the time the answer was
something like &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you put some advertisements on there, so I don&rsquo;t have to pay?&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="finding-an-appropriate-problem">Finding an appropriate problem</h2>
<p>If I spent this much time on selling it, and they didn&rsquo;t want to pay for it, how would I be able to convince others? Back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>It was only after a while that I really learned to listen to the people I was talking to; I would then adjust my idea, pitch etcetera and try selling that.
While this might seem really obvious now, I do realize it took me about 2 years to evolve from an idea that I assumed to be viable into an idea that was 
really viable.</p>
<p>After some careful listening, I had finally found a problem where people would be willing to pay for the solution, but I had no clue on how to 
provide a solution.</p>
<h2 id="finding-a-solution-and-a-customer-for-the-problem">Finding a solution and a customer for the problem</h2>
<p>It took me another three months and endless discussions to figure out a market where I could actually provide a viable solution for this problem.</p>
<p>I looked in my vast professional and personal network, and finally found a fit for a potential customer. I pitched the idea on a Friday night to this
person, and he told me a person had contacted him for something similar, but that he never got any actual result.</p>
<p>So I promised him to prep a rude demo, so he could have at least an idea what I was talking about. This talk took about 10 minutes tops.</p>
<h1 id="selling-ittickling-the-prospects-imagination">Selling it/tickling the prospect&rsquo;s imagination</h1>
<p>I spent most of the weekend and a whole Monday on building a POC that would show the essence of my idea using a very rudimentary approach.</p>
<p>I sent the email on Monday evening (including the link) and by Tuesday noon, he knocked on my door.</p>
<p>He explained what they were doing and what their utopian situation would be. Then he asked what my intent was.</p>
<p>I gave away some pointers, not raising expectations too much, 
and asked for a meeting in his office in the next week, where I would elaborate on my ideas. This meeting took about half an hour.</p>
<p>In the concept of under-promising and over-delivering, I spent over a week building a POC website.</p>
<p>Every single day I had at least one person performing 
a usability test. Every single person was an acquaintance, and I just gave them the url, looked at their screen and said nothing.</p>
<h2 id="assumptions-are-wrong-until-verified">Assumptions are wrong until verified</h2>
<p>Seeing these users using the website for the first time, I noticed a lot of my assumptions were completely wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users do not read sentences on the screen longer then a few words.</li>
<li>Users should only be asked to do one thing, I separated a single step into 5 steps during the week.</li>
<li>The thing you consider the key feature might not be noticed by your users, or easily forgotten. Adjust your user interface to make things more obvious.</li>
<li>Simplify, optimize for the majority. (I.e. do not complect things, but use sensible defaults).</li>
</ul>
<p>I branded the product to my prospect&rsquo;s site, and in the meeting I put a copy of their site with the link to my product on the big screen before we started.</p>
<h2 id="rehearsals-help">Rehearsals help</h2>
<p>By the time I had to give my demo, I was confident enough to ask &ldquo;the person who&rsquo;s the least experienced with computers in the organisation&rdquo; to join us, 
and take a seat behind the keyboard. I told him to click the link, and then I just kept my mouth shut&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="i-have-a-dream">&ldquo;I have a dream&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The prospect was over the moon, they wanted it yesterday, and they saw umphteen possible extension points. Then we talked about money: I told them I was
in favour of no-cure/no-pay and that seemed to be a perfect fit.</p>
<p>They proposed me to invoice an amount reasonable enough to bootstrap the development, so we could get cracking&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="building-the-product">Building the product</h1>
<p>I am currently in the process of building the product, having very short iteration cycles, constantly publishing new versions, and looking for feedback 
from anyone I can get a hold of. I am not only asking feedback on usability, but also on my code from various persons. Talking to everyone about my product
also allowed me to discover a lot of hidden value in my personal network, with tips which will probably help to alleviate the customer&rsquo;s sales even more.</p>
<p>As my income is based on a no-cure/no-pay model, I actually have the same goal as my customer: driving sales, so it is both in my and their benefit to
optimize anywhere we can (which might even be after my client&rsquo;s customer used my product).</p>
<p>I will suggest them anything that will grow their conversion rate, even if it is not related to my product.</p>
<p>I am currently in the process of building the first version, so I can not tell you how it ends yet&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping it up</h1>
<p>When I initially learned about the lean start-up, I assumed it was a triangle. After a few iterations, I noticed it was a series of triangle in the main 
triangle. Another few years, and the pattern finally emerges:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.snag.gy/kGcvM.jpg" alt="build-measure-learn"></p>
<h2 id="key-takeaway">Key takeaway</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The whole build-measure-learn thing should be recursively repeated ad libitum. Apply it everywhere!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The attentive reader might recall this pattern as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle">Sierpinski&rsquo;s triangle</a></p>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>

                <h3>The very first #DDDBE event: the modellathon</h3>
                
            </div>

            <p>This is my personal review of the <a href="https://twitter.com/dddbe">@DDDBE</a> inaugural meeting: a <a href="https://modellathon.eventbrite.com/">modellathon</a>.</p>
<h1 id="some-background-info">Some background info</h1>
<p>So, last night we had the very first event of <a href="http://domaindriven.be/">the Belgian DDD community</a>: a modellathon facilitated by <a href="https://twitter.com/mathiasverraes">Mathias Verraes</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/stijnvnh">Stijn Vannieuwenhuyse</a>, and kindly hosted by the hosting company <a href="https://twitter.com/combell">Combell</a>.</p>
<p>For the people who do not know the concept of a modellathon - in fact, I think we might even have invented the term maybe, but I am not quite sure -, it was something we spiked like a while a go, while coming back from the <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/design-architecture/dddx-2013">London DDD Exchange</a>:
As we were sitting together on the train with some of the <a href="https://twitter.com/ToJans/statuses/297059516049137664">#CQRSBeers</a> guys, we considered starting a Belgian DDD community, and having real workshops.</p>
<p>Somehow the idea for the first workshop emerged: instead of having hackathons (hacking away on code), why not have a modellathon (hacking away on domain models).</p>
<h3 id="update">UPDATE</h3>
<p>Apparently the modellathon term was <a href="https://twitter.com/JefClaes">Jef Claes</a>' idea !</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ToJans">@ToJans</a> For the record, I coined the term on our way back from DDDX ;)</p>&mdash; Jef Claes (@JefClaes) <a href="https://twitter.com/JefClaes/statuses/375266359875481600">September 4, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>So one thing came to another, and all of a sudden we were in this situation:</p>
<h1 id="the-modellathon">The modellathon</h1>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Kickoff of the first <a href="https://twitter.com/DDDBE">@dddbe</a> event the <a href="https://twitter.com/combell">@combell</a> offices: the modellathon! <a href="http://t.co/moCuAjYqqS">pic.twitter.com/moCuAjYqqS</a></p>&mdash; Tom Janssens (@ToJans) <a href="https://twitter.com/ToJans/statuses/374938677522464768">September 3, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<!-- more -->
Our assignment for the workshop was to model a system that was used as a reporting tool in the Kazachstan Education System.
<p>This was not your average fictuous model, we even received some official Kazachstan documents:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DDDBE&amp;src=hash">#DDDBE</a> is starting, and I have the strong feeling that <a href="https://twitter.com/DDD_Borat">@DDD_Borat</a> has his filthy fingers in this ;) <a href="http://t.co/q1LjjACz4d">pic.twitter.com/q1LjjACz4d</a></p>&mdash; Marco Heimeshoff (@Heimeshoff) <a href="https://twitter.com/Heimeshoff/statuses/374940972167495680">September 3, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>We were divided into groups of 4 people, trying to make sure that at least one person having experience in domain modelling was in every group.</p>
<p>Just to elaborate on the &ldquo;experienced&rdquo; part: when we asked who had experience in domain modelling, not a lot of fingers went up, but when we asked who had managed to build a domain model in the past, that somehow turned out to be completely wrong, some more fingers went up.</p>
<p>The role of the expert was just to find a way to get started, but once you have the juices flowing, the expert&rsquo;s opinion is as valuable as anyone else&rsquo;s. So it is more about facilitating the process then being good in the whole modelling part.</p>
<h1 id="on-to-the-modelling-part">On to the modelling part</h1>
<p>During the first pomodoro of the modellathon (after a general introduction by the domain experts), people started experimenting with different kinds of modelling at different groups.</p>
<p>A lot of people were trying to use the event storming approach - as they had experienced the value of the technique in a really great workshop with <a href="https://twitter.com/ziobrando">Alberto Brandolini</a> during <a href="https://twitter.com/VaughnVernon">Vaughn Vernon</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http://idddtour.com/">IDDD tour</a> in <a href="http://tojans.me/blog/2013/05/01/idddtour-2013-belgium-an-immersive-experience/">Belgium</a>.</p>
<p>Somehow this approach did not feel valuable to us in this phase of the domain analysis, as the question was more about the report we initially got:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why was having only this piece of paper not a viable solution?</li>
<li>Why does the business need the system? What does it need to do?</li>
</ul>
<p>So we started asking questions from there, and all of a sudden the domain experts were mentioning concepts like observations and evaluations. So instead of focussing on the part where you process grades/tests/students/whatever, the domain experts were  focussed on that part; the report was only a deliverable from the system, not the system in itself.</p>
<p>From this knowledge we could build a conceptual model of teachers being able to track the observations, progress and expectations in a graph-like model with time on one axis and skill on the other, just finding a way to represent the domain to the experts on paper&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="http://i.snag.gy/x17zw.jpg" alt="It is only the left half, the right half came in the next pomodoro"></p>
<p>The @DDDBE guys decided to put a picture of us explaining our model on twitter, and I would like to sincerely thank them for for photographing me from my best side ;-).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>. <a href="https://twitter.com/ToJans">@ToJans</a> is showing off a model of pupil reports for the Kazakhstan Education System <a href="http://t.co/ZjIhMj2amZ">pic.twitter.com/ZjIhMj2amZ</a></p>&mdash; Belgian DDD group (@DDDBE) <a href="https://twitter.com/DDDBE/statuses/374951596805095424">September 3, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>After another pomodoro, we evolved into this high overview model where we found out that observations (like grades, tests, but also subjective observations) were not always side-effect free, and there had to be some kind of a formal evaluation process for an observation; this finally resulted in the flow of
observation (1..n) -&gt; evaluation (1..n) -&gt; progress x learning goals (1..n) -&gt; expectations and back&hellip;.</p>
<p>Then all of a sudden <a href="https://twitter.com/yreynhout">the DDD cowboy - AKA Yves Reynhout</a> came along, and he stated the model might be to abstract to be usable, and challenged us to mock up a UI to prove it.</p>
<p>So we did, and by building this mockup for the evaluation part, we managed to get an even deeper understanding of the domain&hellip;</p>
<p>We noticed the higher level overview might have been all that was required for this particular bounded context or subdomain, because it made sense by mocking up the UI.</p>
<p>The most interesting part however, is how we progressed from mapping nouns  from the specs to trying to find out why the system was needed (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys">Root cause analysis/5 why&rsquo;s - anyone?</a>).
Then, by modelling our UI mockup, we were able to verify whether our assumed domain model would be usable in the real world&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Well, this was a really interesting exercise to perform; I think the biggest lesson in all this, was to experiment, and not being afraid of starting over, especially using a different modelling approach. As we all observed in the end, and Mathias mentioned in the beginning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful&rdquo; - George Edward Pelham Box</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence, we could coin the concept model storming (initally mentioned by Mr. Brandolini I assume - give credit when it&rsquo;s due -) as the best approach to doing things: find several ways to model your domain, and gain new insights every time you do it.</p>
<h1 id="a-note-about-the-dddbe-community">A note about the #DDDBE community</h1>
<p>Well, there is not a lot to say about that from my side, except that you were all pretty awesome; this was a huge experiment, but somehow we managed to get an interactive workshop where A LOT of people contributed.</p>
<p>Based on the feedback you provided, I am quite confident we can do a lot more with this community, so once again, everyone, feel free to suggest and improve, or even join!!</p>
<p>We also had - once again - some interesting discussions afterwards, and I even managed to see a fellow DDD practitioner (which shall remain unnamed) perform a musical masterpiece on the day after!</p>

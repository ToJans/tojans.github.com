	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>There has been a lot of buzz lately about <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/03/05/TheStartUpTrap.html" target="_blank">a post of Uncle Bob Martin</a>, who claims that skipping Test-driven design is the worst mistake you can make when in a startup. This generated a lot of yay-and-nays on the twitter sphere, with mostly black and white opinions. I think they might all be right, but miss one important distinction: you always need to formalize what you are working on&#8230;</p>
<h3>&#8220;So what&#8221; - Miles Davis</h3>
<p>In my opinion, you need something to drive your behavior of your app, or as you put it in the context of startups, you need something to drive your search for a market fit. So while TDD might provide you &#8220;better&#8221; code in the end, it is not the code that matters, it is the behavior of the code that is all important. TDD for a startup should help you to reason about that behavior, i.e. what exactly are you trying to achieve.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Defining in an explicit way what (and even why) you are going to do something before you do it, allows you to:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>focus on your task</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>define scope</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>reason about it in a strategic way</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are able to reason about what you are about to do in another way, please feel free. I can think of at least 5 ways to define what you are doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>An explicit analysis document</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming" target="_blank">Literate programming</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">TDD</a></li>
<li>BDD (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development" target="_blank">behavior-</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business-driven_development" target="_blank">business</a>-)</li>
<li>Interface-driven design, the top down approach (although this is probably one of the lesser approaches)</li>
<li>&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<div><img src="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/image.axd?picture=2013%2f3%2fCunningplan.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>So, whatever comes naturally to you might be the best fit. The most important thing is making something explicit (aka &#8220;ze cunning plan&#8221;), as I have found out multiple times in the past: without a proper plan to support your vision, you are doomed to wander around in eternity, as you never have a proper definition of done and/or scope, or even priorities&#8230;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>As a developer, the best fit for me is usually some kind of a bastardized combo of all the techniques mentioned above, even combined with some <a href="http://impactmapping.org/">impact mapping</a> or other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design" target="_blank">DDD </a>techniques&#8230;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>On a sidenote: currently halfway into <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0321834577" target="_blank">Vaughn&#8217;s IDDD book</a>, and this proves to be very helpfull as well, it&#8217;s like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=bxgy_cc_b_img_b/185-2294219-9118450" target="_blank">Eric Evan&#8217;s blue book</a>, but written in a more accessible and pleasant way&#8230;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So in the end, what it all comes down to, is that you need a formal/explicit spec about what you are working on, whether that is a design doc, some unit tests or something else, does not really mather; just find out whatever fits your methods best.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Murphy,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Pssssssssssssssssssssssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhtt !!!!</em></strong></p>
<p>&#8230; That was exactly the sound I was hearing when I got up early this Saturday morning (6.30AM&#8217;ish).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last months I have been billing on average about 9 to 10 hours per day for my customer, and those hours do not include my 30 to 60 minute lunchbreaks and my 3 to 5 hours spent on commuting when I decide not to sleep over, so you can imagine my time for doing things on the side is rather scarse at this moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the weekends, I am usually at one/both of my son&#8217;s soccer matches, or getting back on track with my family and some friends, which I do not see during the week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still have 2 books to finish and review/write a blog post about it, and have not been able to do this just yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today is Saturday, and I need to be at my parent&#8217;s by 8.00AM where we meetup to disassemble, transport and temporarily store my brother&#8217;s new kitchen they will use after their renovation. This will probably take the whole day, so I decided to get up at 6.30AM, because I wanted to answer some mails today. (Knowing myself, I will probably not be any the mood for this tonight anyway, as we will probably have a night out with the &#8220;kitchen disassembling crew&#8221;.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I got up at 6.30AM, ready to get started on these mails, as I heard a slightly disturbing sound&#8230; &#8220;PSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHT&#8221;; a continuous hiss.</p>
<p>As we do not have any gas plumbing in the house, I was not exactly afraid of explosions, but it was slightly disturbing nevertheless, so I went searching for the source of the sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I arrived in the cellar - all in my nightwear, for people with a lot of imagination -, I noticed our pression vessel from our rain water pump contained a very small dot of rust where water was streaming out at high pressure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I opened up some faucets to release the pressure, and started mobbing away, as we also store our heating pellets in our cellar - luckily I did not put them directly at the floor, otherwise the first few bags would have been ruined as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, instead of answering my emails, I decided to get my priorities straight, and take the explicit time to thank you and send you my regards, Mr. Murphy, as you apparently also went the extra mile to surprise me with this great morning gift &#8230;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tom</p>
<p>Your Humble Servant</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Sometimes you get lucky, and find a way where you can truely do the things you like in work&#8230; But why does luck always seem to be distributed unevenly, and does it always land with the same people&#8230;</p>
<p>Here is a message for you: it does not! You can get lucky once by accident, but getting lucky multiple times seems to be quite impossible (not considering statistical anomylies).</p>
<p>So I decided to write a post with some lessons learned from my personal experience&#8230;</p>
<h3>Be more receptive to luck</h3>
<p>Let us begin with the first quote</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;If opportunity doesn&#8217;t knock, build a door&rdquo; - Milton Berle</em></p>
<p>Simple, is it not; the reason some people are more lucky then others, is because they are willing to see the opportunities&#8230;.</p>
<p>I will give you 3 more quotes to tickle your motivation on changing life, work, and all other things related to carbon-based lifeforms:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.&rdquo;<br />&#8220;If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.&#8221;<br />&ldquo;When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be&rdquo;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> - Lao Tzu</em></p>
<p>Here is the thing: people always want something, but are afraid to get out of their current comfort zone. If you really want it: stop making excuses and just do it! Ask yourself: what is the worst thing that could happen? Usually things are not that bad, and you can almost always find a plan B&#8230;</p>
<p>Millions of opportunities might fly by, but people tend to always find an excuse and somehow assume the worst-case scenario will happen so they talk themselves out of it&#8230;</p>
<p>This brings us to the next part&#8230; </p>
<h3>Be willing to leave your comfort zone</h3>
<p>This is hard for most of the people I meet, but is essential in my opinion. I will mention a quote from Ashton Kutcher - yes, Ashton Kutcher, quoting him is definately out of my comfort zone ;) -:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m continually trying to make choices that put me against my own comfort zone. As long as you&#8217;re uncomfortable, it means you&#8217;re growing.&#8221; <br />Ashton Kutcher&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People always ask me how I manage to keep up and do so much interesting things and jobs&#8230; Well, that&#8217;s easy: I spend time doing new things, way out of my comfort zone, so people consult me about those new things - makes sense, does it not?</p>
<p>This also implies you have to make sacrifices, because you doing new things might imply that you have to be able to sacrifice other things&#8230; Which brings me to the next part:</p>
<h3>Get your priorities straight</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;But I need to pay my bills&#8221; - almost everybody when we talk about this</em></p>
<p>Do you really need to have all the latest/biggest/best/most expensive/coolest phone/stereo/car/house/clothing/&#8230; Do you really need to go on a trip to an expensive hotel 3 times a year?</p>
<p>You might, or you might not&#8230; What you do is all about choices. While you are working you cannot spend time with your kids, for example&#8230; While you are earning hard cash for that new car, you probably can not spend that time on some new tech you would like to learn about&#8230;</p>
<p>Also, most people tend to forget why they started doing things, but just seem to be wandering on the road, always going forward, without evaluating where they wanted to go in the first place.</p>
<h3>Do not be afraid of failure, but consider it part of the process</h3>
<p>Failure is a part of life; accept that big plans will fail, but learn from your failure. There is a difference between a failure and a mistake: read<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/12/the-difference-between-a-failure-and-a-mistake.html" target="_blank"> Seth&#8217;s blog article on it</a>. Do this now!!!</p>
<p>Here is an English proverb that you should remember:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Most people do not succeed at once&#8230; They might forget to tell you that, but there are usually a huge pile of failures before becoming succesfull. The important part is that it is a process, where you learn from your mistakes, so you do not make the same mistake another time&#8230;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;In order to succeed, your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure.&#8221; &nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;</em><em>Bill Cosby&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another great quote which points out that you should accept it and go with the flow&#8230;.</p>
<h3>Last but not least</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Be happy for this moment. This moment is your life.&nbsp;&#8221; - Omar Khayyam</em></p>
<p>This is easily forgotten: most people are so tied up with their target, that they do not appreciate the current situation.</p>
<p>Whenever I am in a situation where some things seem to be &#8220;unlucky&#8221; and I take a step back to reflect, I usually find out that it is only a small part that I am unlucky with, so I act until it changes.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for a Saturday night 30min brain dump. Later folks!</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2012/12/01/simplified-feature-branching-source-control-done-right/" itemprop="url">Simplified Feature Branching - Source Control Done Right</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As one does typically develop features in parallel, and some features can not be released while others can, a lot of software teams seem to have problems with their source control.</p>
<p>In this post I will describe <strong>Simplified Feature Branching</strong> usable with git or any other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control">DVCS</a>.</p>
<p>This model is not rocket science, and is a further simplification of <a href="http://dymitruk.com/blog/2012/02/05/branch-per-feature/">Adam Dymitruk&#8217;s post on feature branching</a>.</p>
<p>It assumes you use proper release cycles and versioning during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_Development_Life_Cycle">software development lifecycle</a>.</p>
<p>Whenever I mention &#8220;feature&#8221; in this post, I actually mean &#8220;feature&#8221; or &#8220;bugfix&#8221;, but I am a lazy b*d.</p>
<h2>The main idea: simplification</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler - <em>Albert Einstein</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever things start to get complicated, we should attempt to simplify them by breaking it up into smaller parts. This is exactly what <strong>Simplified Feature Branching</strong> does. We make the distinction between branching and integration.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Feature (and bugfix) branches</h2>
<p>In large development teams we typically have the problem that several things are developed in parallel, and need to be integrated afterwards. What we will do is separate these two concepts.</p>
<p>We will forget about integration for now, and will just create a branch for every new feature or bugfix we perform. We will give the branch a proper name (usually that will be some kind of an ID we get from a tracking tool).</p>
<p>The Development repository would look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development          
<ul>
<li>master          
<ul>
<li>[Bugfix] *</li>
<li>[Feature] *</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development          
<ul>
<li>master          
<ul>
<li>Bug-sales-123123</li>
<li>Bug-marketing-5454</li>
<li>Feature-sales-444</li>
<li>&#8230;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All branches would be children of Development/master. Exceptions are not allowed, unless you really, really need it and know what you are doing.</p>
<p>This is exactly the same as <a href="http://dymitruk.com/blog/2012/02/05/branch-per-feature/">Adam&#8217;s model</a>.</p>
<h2>Integration branches</h2>
<p>Integration branches are the branches where we integrate the different features in a new branch. A typical workflow during development would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch 
git checkout development/master -B Bugfix-1231 
...
git checkout development/master -B Feature-5454
...
</code></pre>
<p>Once we are satisfied with this integration, we typically deploy this dev branch to the shared development environment.</p>
<p><strong>Never alter development/master!!</strong></p>
<p>Important to note here, is that the whole process described here is targeting the development process, not release management, and this is exactly where the simplification starts.</p>
<p>Integration branches are just temporary placeholders. Think about it! Integration branches should be dropped and recreated once a release is finalized!!!</p>
<p>I would even suggest you to make this explicit by having a distinct repository for the release integration. As one typically goes through a process where multiple clients might have requested different features, I would opt for the following approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repo: development          
<ul>
<li>master          
<ul>
<li>[Bugfix] *</li>
<li>[Feature] *</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repo: releases          
<ul>
<li>master          
<ul>
<li>staging</li>
<li>QA/[customer] *</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the simplification: integration branches are just temporary things, which can be dropped and recreated as you want. Let&#8217;s say you want to setup a QA environment for a certain customer in the releases repo:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch
git checkout development/master -B QA/JohnTitor
git checkout development/Bugfix-1231 -B Bugfix-1231
git rebase QA/JohnTitor
git checkout QA/JohnTitor
git merge Bugfix-1231
git checkout development/Feature-5454 -B Feature-5454
git rebase QA/JohnTitor 
git checkout QA/JohnTitor
git merge Bugfix-1231
git push release QA/JohnTitor -f
</code></pre>
<p>This will allow you to have proper branches per customer QA environments and a staging environment (for the final release), while having an acceptable merge tree. IF you want a single commit per feature branch (which makes it easy to revert a feature if necessary), it is advisable to run a interactive rebase in order to make sure every feature is a single commit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once a the version on the staging environment has been approved by all the customers, we do the following:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout master
git merge staging
git tag v1.2.3
</code></pre>
<p>As all changes are now integrated in the master, we can drop all the feature branches.</p>
<pre><code>git branch -D Bugfix-1231
git branch -D Feature-5454
git branch -D ...
</code></pre>
<p>So all your releases are on the main branch. Once a release is done, you open up git on the development repository, and type the following:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout master
git pull --rebase releases
</code></pre>
<p>And voila, your development repository is up to date!!!</p>
<h2>And an added bonus</h2>
<p>One does not have to have a single development repository, for example one could have one per development team/country/division/&#8230; (In my current project we will use a separate repository for outsourced work for example). This approach would also integrate very nicely with code reviews and other CI-related things.</p>
<p>By creating this <strong>simplified feature branching</strong> model, one clearly separates responsibilities using multiple repositories, and make sure the whole integration process is centralized and separated from development.</p>
<p>Happy <strong>simplified feature branching</strong> everyone!!</p>
<p>PS: do not forget to enable <a href="http://git-scm.com/2010/03/08/rerere.html">git rerere</a> when merging git branches; this might save you a lot of time&#8230; In fact Adam even suggests sharing your merge cache folder&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>During one of my more recent interviews I got an assesment from two different persons. While I still have no idea about the definitive outcome, the different types of questions they both asked triggered me to think about what kind of personality type they would be, so I started wondering how personality types are related to development&#8230;.</p>
<h2>First things first: MBTI</h2>
<p>Before we can determine the effect of your personality on your development, we will start by defining MBTI, so let us begin with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator">the wikipedia definition</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) assessment is a psychometric questionnaire designed to measure psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They do this by categorizing your personality in four dimensions; your gradation in every dimension is not a boolean, but rather a range (i.e. -1 to +1).</p>
<p>I will describe each of the four dimensions in detail, and explain how they impact your development:</p>
<h2>#1 Attitude: &#8220;Extraversion&#8221; versus &#8220;Intraversion&#8221; (E vs I)</h2>
<p>Attitude is about the way evolve an idea and get inspired: some get inspired by doing and experimenting, while others get inspired by thinking about things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Development by people with high &#8220;Extraversion&#8221; is driven by    
<ul>
<li>experimenting with code</li>
<li>evolving ideas in small incremental steps by talking with other people</li>
<li>doing things right</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Development by people with high &#8220;Intraversion&#8221; is driven by    
<ul>
<li>an internal thought process</li>
<li>thinking ideas through before talking about it with other people</li>
<li>doing the right thing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On a sidenote, &#8220;extraversion&#8221; is not a typo; it is the way you spell this word in MBTI terms.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>#2 Percieving: &#8220;Sensing&#8221; versus &#8220;iNtuition&#8221; (S vs N)</h2>
<p>The second dimension is about how we percieve things&#8230; Some need to see the details (sensing), other  just have a general sense (i.e. intuition) of what it is supposed to do. This has obviously a rather big impact in the way that we write code&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Development by people with high sensing is usually explicit    
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Hmmz I need to know all the ins and outs before I use this, how does this tiny bit work?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Always use explicit typing everywhere, no exceptions!!&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;This looks dirty, I need to change this&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Coding without conventions? Always use the &#8216;private&#8217; keyword, even though it is implicit&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Development by people with high iNtuition is usually implicit    
<ul>
<li>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care how it works, when it is important to know I will find it out&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;dynamic and var are my friends&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I will refactor it when it hurts&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Ok, I will follow the coding conventions if you really force me&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>#3 Judging: &#8220;Thinking&#8221; versus &#8220;Feeling&#8221; (T vs F)</h2>
<p>I quite honestly have not met a single developer who was a &#8220;feeling&#8221; type; every single one I met was a rational type (which is kind of a logical thing - pun intended).</p>
<p>A lot of recruiters on the other hand, are usually a &#8220;feeling&#8221; type, hence this is probably a part of the problem I stated in <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Fallacies-of-the-tech-recruitment-process.aspx">one of my previous blog posts</a>.</p>
<h2>#4 Lifestyle: &#8220;judging&#8221; versus &#8220;perceiving&#8221; (J vs P)</h2>
<p>The final one is about which one of #2 and #3 you use the most to interact with the world: your &#8220;judging&#8221; or your &#8220;percieving part&#8221;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Development by a &#8220;judging&#8221; developer    
<ul>
<li>usually driven by a detailed plan</li>
<li>not deadline-driven </li>
<li>tends to be quite rigid when executing something, sometimes to rigid</li>
<li>works first, plays later</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Development by a &#8220;perceiving&#8221; developer    
<ul>
<li>driven by external impulses (Sensing or iNtuition)</li>
<li>deadline-driven</li>
<li>likes to keep his/her options open, sometimes indecisive</li>
<li>works in bursts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>So how is this related to the assesment ?</h2>
<p>When having an interview, it usually helps if the interviewer&#8217;s personality matches the interviewee&#8217;s as much as possible&#8230; There are compatibility matrices available for MBTI types which also mention opposites (f.e. my wife is my MBTI opposite), but I think this is not an advantage when doing an interview.</p>
<p>As an ENTP myself, I met two interviewers, and based on their questions I would guess that the first interviewer was an ISTP and the second one an INTP. (Not sure about the first letter, as interviewers tend to be intraverted during an interview.)</p>
<p>It does not take a genious to find out in which interview I performed best&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Update: I got pinged by both an INFP and an INFJ, so apparently the F part is still there for some developers. Next to this I misjudged my interviewers; they are ISTJ and ESTJ.. My bad!!! (but in my defense, the second one still matches my profile better then the first one&#8230;.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>I also received some food for thought from Rob Ashton:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="nl">
<p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/tojans">tojans</a> don&#8217;t think I agree with I/E - I think N/S is the biggest factor for dev, followed by J/P and I/E is about how you interact</p>
&mdash; &#8216;Hurricane Rob&#8217; (@RobAshton) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobAshton/status/269714326934396928">november 17, 2012</a></blockquote>
<p>
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Finally</h2>
<p>If you are a developer, this should give you a general idea of the MBTI type you are exactly. If you really want to find out, there is a short free questionaire online to determine your MBTI type <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp">here</a>.</p>
<p>On a sidenote, it would be great if the interviewers would be willing to send me a message whether I am correct or not with my guesstimate&#8230;</p>
<p>Signing off,</p>
<p>Tom</p>

		<p>Note: I would like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/gbarrs">@gbarrs</a> for reviewing my blog post almost instantly, and also the offer of  <a href="https://twitter.com/GraemeF">@GraemeF</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkRendle">@MarkRendle</a>,  <a href="https://twitter.com/swaggerdmangene">@swaggerdmangene</a> and  <a href="https://twitter.com/moldyseaswimmer">@moldyseaswimmer</a> to be a reviewer. Without them, there would be a lot more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunglish">Dunglish</a> in this post&#8230;</p>
<h2>Why I like my job.</h2>
<p>I have been hooked into computers ever since I wrote my first few lines of Basic on my mothers&#8217; brand new <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/trs80iii.html">TRS-80 Model 3</a> with 64Kb of ram and 2 - yes 2 !!! - diskdrives of a whopping 178Kb.  (Actually, I did not write the code, but I copied it character by character from <a href="http://www.1000bit.it/support/manuali/trs/Introduction%20to%20TRS-80%20Level%20II%20BASIC%20%281980%29%28Michael%20Zabinski%29%28pdf%29.pdf">a textbook that might have looked like this</a>, but in my defense, I was about 7 years old).</p>
<p>The first program probably looked like this:</p>
<p><code>10 PRINT "HI, WHAT IS YOUR NAME?"</code></p>
<p><code>20 INPUT N$</code></p>
<p><code>30 PRINT "HELLO, ",N$</code></p>
<p>Exciting, is it not? In the five years that followed, I learned almost every in and out of this machine, where to peek and poke in memory, how to set pixels on the screen (monochrome, 128x48 resolution, imagine that), which ASCII codes to send to my dot matrix printer to switch control modes, &#8230;</p>
<p>When I was about twelve years old, I had written a drawing application, complete with circles, boxes, Bresenham lines, and even the possibility to print the graphics on the (very noisy) dot matrix printer (remember those printers which had to print on chained paper?).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then we got our first 80286, an IBM-compatible PC that ran at a mind-boggling speed of 16 Mhz, with 4 megs of memory and a color VGA screen&#8230; A screen buffer of 320x200 pixels with 256 colors was available directly by poking at the #A000 segment, and we discovered a whole brave new world out there using color pallette rotation, and apps like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluxe_Paint">Deluxe Paint</a>. We even managed to do blitting by <a href="http://www.wagemakers.be/english/doc/vga">reprogramming the VGA-card directly</a> by poking video card ports and bypassing BIOS&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6c/Snapshot_DeluxePaint_II_MSDOS.png" alt="Our GFX artist probably spent thousands of hours in Deluxe Paint" /></p>
<p>As years progressed I got involved in the Belgian BBS/hacking/cracking scene, but after one of our fellow BBS&#8217;s got all his material confiscated, we decided to focus on the demo scene, as we had some experience writing some &#8220;cool intros&#8221; for our and other BBS&#8217;s.</p>
<p>In the demo scene, we were not very succesfull, but we did have a lot of fun. (This was the pre-internet-era folks, so figuring out how to write a software 3D rasterizer from disassembling other demo &#8216;exe&#8217; files was a bit of a challenge. The example below was one of those demos we completely disassembled to figure out how everything worked.)</p>

</p>
<p>The biggest achievement that is now still traceable would probably be the fact that I did manage to come <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=8765">second in a 4K assembler demo on a demo party in Mons</a> (Which is now, in the hardware-accelerated era, probably pretty unspectacular) .</p>
<h2>Fast forward to a few years later&#8230;</h2>
<p>I walked a very diverse path, both in programming languages (e.g. all kinds of Basic, Turbo Pascal, x86 assembly, C, C++, C&#8211;, (PL/Transact)-SQL, Smalltalk, lua, ruby, shell scripts, C#, some 4GL&#8217;s and probably a dozen of others), in platforms (pre-PC area, Windows, *nix , VMS, AS400, &#8230;) as well as in my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/tomjanssens">career</a> (Oracle dev/DBA, C++ dev, c# dev, ICT manager, technical analist, independent consultant).</p>
<p>As I got involved with .Net (I wrote my first app framework when independent using a Beta of .Net 1.0), I started focussing on this new thing, first Winforms, and afterwards ASP.NET, and finally ASP.NET MVC.</p>
<p>I skipped things like Silverlight, WCF, WWF and XAML as they all seemed way to much overhead for achieving something to me.</p>
<p>However, in the last few years I started realizing something&#8230;</p>
<h2>If you focus on the tech stack, you are focussing on the wrong thing!</h2>
<p>Spending all those years behind a PC and the last 15 years interacting with both business and development, I started realizing the biggest problem is not in the tech stack, but it is in the interaction between business and technology that the biggest problems occur.</p>
<p>From my numerous experiences with all those different environments, I know by experience that <strong>learning a new tech thing usually takes somewhere between a week and a few months before you can be productive</strong> (becoming an expert is a different thing, but that is not what I am referring to here).</p>
<p>The hardest part is not in the tech, but it is in <strong>learning how to scope, plan and build software that matches the business&#8217; expectations</strong>. That is something one cannot learn in a few weeks, let alone months.</p>
<p>This is exactly the reason why I read <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Continuous-thinking-Essential-business-books-shortlist-3-business-books-everyone-should-have-read.aspx">numerous business books</a> every year, and have taken several sabatticals of a few months studying new things (more specific: <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/?tag=/BDD">Behaviour Driven Development</a>, Domain Driven Design including the <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/?tag=/CQRS">Command-Query responsibility Seggregation thing</a>, as well as the whole <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Project-Startup10-Learning-to-build-your-own-business.aspx">Lean startup development process</a>).</p>
<p>I did make some mistakes in the past, but hey, I am learning from them&#8230; (On a side-note, you should really check out <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/12/the-difference-between-a-failure-and-a-mistake.html">this blog post from Seth Godin</a> about the difference between a failure and a mistake.)</p>
<h2>&#8220;What does this have to do with the tech recruitment process?&#8221;</h2>
<p>The last few years all my business leads came from my personal or online network. Some experiences turned out pretty good, and some a bit less.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my current client&#8217;s project got delayed for a few months at first, and cancelled afterwards by his customer, so I am currently short on leads. (Luckily they are now giving me the opportunity to migrate them from a waterfall to a more scrum-like approach, so I am not quite broke yet; however, the job ends this month.)</p>
<p>As I got short on leads, I decided to accellerate my job/project search using companies that play an intermediate between me and the customer, and I was flabbergasted by most of them&#8230;</p>
<h2>Most recruiters just seem to play &#8220;Keyword lottery&#8221;</h2>
<p>People from my personal/social network <strong>do not hire me because I know a certain tech stack, they hire me because they think I am capable of solving the problem they have.</strong></p>
<p>However, <strong>almost</strong> every recruiter that contacts me - the exceptions know who they are - just search their database for keywords, and contact you based on those keywords. In the rare case that you do get asked some technical questions, the interviewers either do not know anything about the subject, or they start asking questions about the things irrelevant to the job.</p>
<p>In my experience <strong>this keyword approach is as usefull as taking an asprin when your leg is broken</strong>. Here is an excerpt from a recent conversation I had with Szymon Pobiega on twitter:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="nl">
<p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/tojans">tojans</a> Same for any technology, approach and methodology. Juniors tend to write they are experts if they heard a buzzword more than 3 times</p>
&mdash; Szymon Pobiega (@SzymonPobiega) <a href="https://twitter.com/SzymonPobiega/status/268951237389598720">november 15, 2012</a></blockquote>
<p>
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
</p>
<p>Every single recruiter I talk to talks about how they would like to bond and invest into people, and really contribute and build a relationship, so I point them to my blog, and tell them this is exactly who I am. However, almost nobody - again, some exceptions - decided to invest in me by reading the blog and finding out what my exact profile is.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to this rule, and some even go a long way to acquire your trust and confidence, for example the story of github recruitment comes to my mind; who would not love to be treated like that?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="nl">
<p>After doing lots of job interviews, this sounds like Walhalla: the @<a href="https://twitter.com/github">github</a> hiring experience <a title="https://github.com/blog/1269-the-github-hiring-experience" href="https://t.co/yTNE1wxw">github.com/blog/1269-the-&hellip;</a>&#8221; /via @<a href="https://twitter.com/jacopretorius">jacopretorius</a></p>

<h2>Closing up</h2>
<p>I intended to make this a short post (i.e. 1K words), as it was more of a rant then a true essay, but as usual I am having a hard time respecting the limit.</p>
<p>I hope I did not blow any of my own bridges by writing this post, but I find this whole recruiter thing rather frustrating, as the business model for most of them seems to evolve around introducing as many candidates as possible to as many potential customers as possible, filtering only by keywords&#8230;</p>
<p>As the globalization and &#8220;enterprise consumerization&#8221; continues, I assume the world will evolve into an interconnected network of people first and organizations second, so I think that recruitment organizations that are simply focusing on getting the most contracts by using pure volume will not manage to survive in the future. (Maybe they should try reading <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">the Agile manifesto</a>.)</p>
<p>Once again I will close this blog post with a quote:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge.&#8221; - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a></em></p>

<h1>So how is this related to software architecture?</h1>
<p>There is a very well known concept called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect" target="_blank">the 2nd system effect</a> which basically describes a typical evolution of application development:</p>
<h2>System 1: &#8220;I do not have a clue yet&#8221;</h2>
<p>You develop a system, without really knowing all the requirements, so you spike a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank">minimal viable product/prototype</a>, which is really <strong>simple</strong> and deploy it.</p>
<p>The users start using it, and start asking for extra features.</p>
<p>As you start implementing these features, you notice that your current software architecture is lacking a bit, but the <strong>easy</strong> way is to add yet another condition, another prerequisite, include another loop/code to your existing code until it turns into a big ball of mud; it loses the <strong>simplicity</strong> and becomes more <strong>complex</strong>. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory" target="_blank">The black swan theory</a> has a big part in this.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Implementation 1: maintaining existing and implementing new/extra business features gets <strong>harder</strong> and <strong>more complex</strong> on every single step.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>System 2: &#8220;Let&#8217;s make sure we can use it for everything&#8221;</h2>
<p>Knowing what you did wrong in system 1, you provide an over the top architecture, which makes it <strong>easy</strong> to add numerous extensions and adjustements.</p>
<p>However, the extension points and adjustements are adding an extra layer of abstraction, and thus make your code more <strong>complex</strong>. The business implementation is <strong>simple</strong>, but the extensibility is <strong>complex</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Implementation 2: Maintaining existing and implementing new/extra business features is <strong>easy</strong>, but the whole extensibility thing adds a lot of <strong>complexity</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This code is usually a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=PITA" target="_blank">PITA</a> when you are trying to figure out what happened or are trying to debug the code.</p>
<p>For the record: I actually suffered from this as well doing a project for a customer of mine, so I will take this occasion to apologize for my mistake: sorry Arnold!</p>
<h2>System 3: &#8220;Let&#8217;s cut the crap&#8221;</h2>
<p>Finally, one gets to version 3: we understand the necessities and evolution of the project, and are able to build a <strong>simple</strong> system which only abstracts the things that mather, so it avoids <strong>complexity</strong> whenever possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Implementation 3: Maintaining existing and implementing new/extra business features is <strong>easy</strong> and <strong>simple</strong></p>

<h1>Theory is nice, but how about practice?</h1>
<p>In my personal experience, the best way to avoid this, is by not making assumptions in the beginning, as one is typically not able to predict the future - unless your last name is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil" target="_blank">Kurzweill</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Titor" target="_blank">Titor</a>, but that is another discussion - and refactoring code as you notice some smells.</p>
<p>Here are some typical smells:</p>
<ul>
<li>intertangling code, a lot of dependencies</li>
<li>code going several levels deep</li>
<li>copy/paste coding</li>
<li>building for something one might need in the future</li>
<li>Too generic abstractions</li>
<li>&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to refactor code, you need to have some confidence that your application requirements are still met after refactoring, which leads us to the following tool: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development" target="_blank">Behaviour Driven Development(BDD)</a></p>
<p>By using BDD one can find some black swans by exploring the specs with BAs before actually implementing them, and make sure the expected outcomes are still achieved after refactoring.</p>
<p>There is a lot more to BDD then this, but this post is already long enough.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Well, I was in dubio whether I would write this post or not, but writing it all down somehow made me more confident about what to look for when implementing a system: do not create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front" target="_blank">BDUF</a>, but have small incremental changes to your system. Only implement arhitectural patterns when you actually need them, not a minute later or sooner.</p>
<p>I would like to end this post with another one of my favorite quotes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler&#8221; - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_blank">A. Einstein</a></p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This is a follow-up post to <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Paycento-websummit-2012-Is-gra-liom-Eire.aspx">the post from yesterday</a>. While the first day was really nice, the second day was completely different.</p>
<h3>Meeting people</h3>
<p>After a good night of sleep and some breakfast at our AirBnb host, Geert and I got back to the venue. As this was our second day, we seemed to have less challenges handling the Irish traffic in our &#8220;Fiat Cinquecento&#8221;. As we arrived there, we met up with Pieter again we had a small chat about the event he had the night before, had some coffee and a small breakfast (I love the catering at Web Summit), finished some things I had to do on my laptop, and started socializing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>First things first; as Geert introduced me to the guys from <a href="http://8thcolor.com/" target="_blank">8thcolor </a>yesterday - another Belgian start-up -, I decided to go and see what<a href="http://asksybil.com/" target="_blank"> their product &#8220;asksybil&#8221;</a>actually was like. Christophe and Martin gave me a short demo about their product, and I was really amazed: by analyzing your source code commits, they actually make a smart estimate about the experience of a certain developer with a certain tech stack. They then use this data to determine your liabalility on this dependency, and even estimate your risk exposre by looking whether some knowledge is only known by a single person.</p>
<p>By talking with them, I realized I might have a potential lead for them, so I will try to introduce them in the next week into this company.</p>
<p>We also had some great discussions about possible evolutions/alternate paths one could follow with this product; and we decided to keep in touch. I really think this is a product to watch out for&#8230;</p>
<p>Another product I have seen was <a href="http://www.birdbox.com" target="_blank">Birdbox</a>: this is like a tool that aggregates all your pictures and videos over all social networks/sites/&#8230; I am definately going to try the beta of this. As we met over lunch I also told him about another startup idea I had, which in the end seemed to be similar, but not exactly the same; maybe it is still a potential case for my<a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Project-Startup10-Learning-to-build-your-own-business.aspx"> #Startup10 project</a>.</p>
<p>We also met a lot of other people who were actually really interested in building a business relationship with Paycento, so we did achieve what we wanted to achieve on this venue.</p>
<h3>The end is near</h3>
<p>Near the end of the last day, we met the guys from <a href="http://bubobox.com/" target="_blank">BuboBox</a>, another Belgian start-up who walked a path comparable to Paycento. As the venue was closing down, we decided to have a few drinks with them at the pub across the street, and I have to say I had quite some interesting discussions with both of the founders. After Pieter and Geert finished talking to the founder of <a href="http://9gag.com/" target="_blank">9Gag </a>we all regroupeed and had a few beers, but mostly a good chat talking about start-ups, persistence and life in general. (On a sidenote, I also found out one of them actually did read at least one of my blog posts -<a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Epilogue-One-night-in-Paris-CQRS-beers-and-life-in-general.aspx"> the one about the trip to Paris</a> -, which is always great to hear&#8230;)</p>
<p>I also noticed on twitter both <a href="https://twitter.com/RobAshton" target="_blank">@RobAshton</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/GraemeF" target="_blank">@GraemeF</a> were in Dublin for<a href="http://www.nodedublin.com/" target="_blank"> a node conference</a>, but unfortunately we failed to meetup this time&#8230;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/robashton">robashton</a> @<a href="https://twitter.com/graemef">graemef</a> ok; still at the same pub.. another time; enjoy!!!</p>

</p>
<h3>Finally, in closing</h3>
<p>&#8230; we decided to have dinner at an Italian restaurant close to the venue, to discuss the Web Summit, start-ups and Paycento. It was a great evening, and we gained some valuable insights, but also had lots of fun during dinner.</p>
<p>Finally, we headed back to our car, and arrived back at our AirBnb, where we said goodbye to our hostesses, thanking them for their hospitality with some Belgian beer.</p>
<p>So, that is it; Web Summit is gone.</p>
<p>As we have to get up within a few hours, and I still have some other things to do, I will end this post with a quote from Sun Tzu - The art of war:</p>
<p>&#8220;Opportunities multiply as they are seized&#8221;</p>
<p>Good night,</p>
<p>Tom</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h3 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">When Geert from <a href="http://www.paycento.com" target="_blank">Paycento </a>asked me to join him and Pieter to Ireland for THE start-up convention in Ireland named <a href="http://www.websummit.net/" target="_blank">Web Summit</a>, I immediately agreed to join them for the following reasons:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="color: #333333; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">Paycento is still very active, even though we <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/?tag=/Paycento">do not blog about it currently</a>.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">Web Summit is probably the biggest conference for start-ups in Europe, so there is an interesting buzz here, with some really interesting speakers.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px; ">I love interacting with people I do not know yet, especially when we do share similar interests.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px; ">You get to see a whole new world out there, with opportunities you could not even imagine thinking about.</span> </li>
<li><span style="color: #333333; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">And, last but not least: &#8220;Is gr&aacute; liom &Eacute;ire&#8221; - that is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic" target="_blank">Gaelic </a>for &#8220;I love Ireland&#8221; - even though it has been over 10 years ago I spent a few days here, I really like the way Irish people interact and socialize.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here is an overview of our first day!!!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">3&#8230;2&#8230;1&#8230; Lift-off!! We have lift-off!!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">So after a false start (our train arrived a bit on the late side in Brussels, but luckily our plane was delayed as well), we managed to safely land in Dublin, and actually got to our car, which has been the decor for a lot of laughing and Mr. Bean-like &#8220;adventures&#8221; on the Irish roads. Driving left is a bit of a challenge, and I am actually glad I did not bring my driver&#8217;s license - how convenient, isn&#8217;t it, Geert ;) -, because I would probably wind up driving the roundabout in the wrong direction.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/image.axd?picture=2012%2f10%2fws+voituur.png" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So after getting acquinted with our jolly transportation device we managed to arrive to the Web Summit in one piece, where we met Pieter (who had been in Dublin since yesterday evening).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He gave us a short briefing about things to expect and things we should do (i.e. some mere guidance, nothing in particular), we put on our Paycento T-shirts and were ready for take off.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/image.axd?picture=2012%2f10%2fws_paycentobooth.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3>Who did you meet ?</h3>
<p>We met a lot of interesting people, and also found out ther<a href="http://www.bloovi.be/nl/nieuws/N830-invisible-puppy-leidt-belgische-missie-naar-de-dublin-web-summit-2012" target="_blank">e were 13 Belgian companies owning a booth at the convention</a>.</p>
<p>As there are a lot of exibitors, we went by them one by one and talked to some of them.</p>
<p>We also saw a lot of new and interesting approaches to known and unknown things, some of the things were quite amazing. One thing I loved in particular was the booth next to ours, where a company named <a href="http://ovelin.com/" target="_blank">Ovelin </a>showed us a really great app&#8221;<a href="http://www.guitarbots.com" target="_blank">guitarbots</a>&#8221; &nbsp;that listens to you playing the guitar and guides you using a game, so you can learn to play the guitar properly. While testing the app it immediately spotted my wrong grab on the G chord (muting the high E), so it is really kind of an amazing thing, it is like a guitar-teacher-in-a-box.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/image.axd?picture=2012%2f10%2fG-Chord-Shape.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>There were lots and lots more people we met, so this really is a great venue to attend.</p>
<p>There would be way to many here to mention, but I am confident we will hear from some of them in the future&#8230;</p>
<p>We also saw quite a few people there we plan on visiting tomorrow&#8230;.</p>
<p>We also had a really interesting talk with the founder of MySQL who has now started <a href="http://mariadb.org/" target="_blank">MariaDB </a>as a drop-in replacement for MySQL, since he does not like the way MySQL is currently evolving; thank you for the ideas, inspiration and also the glass of Black wodka!</p>

</p>
<h3>The Web Summit conference</h3>
<p>The venue is really well organized, for example the catering really quite extensive (hot/cold platters,sandwiches,soup,&#8230;) and coffee/other drinks are available throughout the building. Everything is included in the ticket price, so you know what you will spend once you have acquired a ticket.</p>
<p>In the evening there are special events, where the whole pub is full of start-up people willing to network, and once again we had quite a few interesting conversations.</p>
<p>We even had the possibilitiy to win a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_Les_Paul" target="_blank">Gibson Les Paul</a>, all we had to do was pose with it. I would love to win it, but I am afraid there were some really original poses in there, so I assume I will somehow not win this contest. -in my defense: I am not a poser ;) -.</p>
<p>We left rather early, since we had some driving to do to our <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">AirBnB </a>host.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>While I had no idea what to expect, I am glad Paycento allowed me to join Web Summit; all in all it is a great experience, and I have both met a lot of interesting people, and we have heard a lot of interesting ideas/opinions.</p>
<p>Feel free to come over and visit us over at booth 197, especially if you are a content provider, press or an investor.</p>
<p>Signing off/see you tomorrow!</p>

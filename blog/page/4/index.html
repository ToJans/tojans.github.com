<h1><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px; ">#1:&nbsp;<a href="http://blommekes.be/" target="_blank">http://Blommekes.Be</a>&nbsp;- koopt een blommeke voor u vrouw en het zal wa beter gaan </span></h1>
<h3><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px; ">Introduction</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px; ">The biggest problem in getting started with startups, is finding your inspiration, and deriving a business plan; in this post I will describe how blommekes.be was conceived, and also mistakes, lessons learned during the process.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px; ">Inspiration</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px; ">After the idea of <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Project-Startup10-Learning-to-build-your-own-business.aspx">starting 10 startups in a year</a> was conceived, this was the first startup that I conceived together with Pieter from <a href="http://www.vertaalbureau-taalvirtuozen.be/" target="_blank">Taalvirtuozen</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px; ">We brainstormed for for about 3 nights straight to find a good idea. The brainstorming process was pretty straightforward: we shared a powerpoint file in google docs, and started adding ideas at random (one per page) while babbling over Skype together. We found our inspiration by surfing the net, (i.e. news sites etc), thinking about where we could find new markets and/or opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #444444;"><span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;">After these 3 nights, we decided to pick an idea and go for it. The odd thing was that we conceived the idea of blommekes.be during that night; the minute we imagined it, we assumed that this would be a perfect match for our first startup: <a href="http://blommekes.be" target="_blank">blommekes.be</a>.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://blommekes.be" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/image.axd?picture=2012%2f7%2fblommekes-site.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #444444;"><span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;"></span></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #444444;"><span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;">Unique selling points</span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #444444;"><span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;">We checked most of the online webshops for flowers, and while there is a stiff competition there, we decided to approach the market from a different point of view. As a man, I have no idea what the current trends are, and I hate having to check in/register and configure umptheen options before getting my final order. We decided to drive blommekes.be by making it utterly simple to order something and target it at people who were just there to order flowers and get it done.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #444444;"><span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;">As we were targetting men only, we decided to approach it with a funny, tongue-in-cheeck, &#8220;us against the women&#8221;- kind of style.</span></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #444444;"><span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;">So it began</span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #444444;"><span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;">Having read through all startup material, we decided to dive in head first, and applying the lean startup mantra &#8220;measuring is knowing&#8221;, so we both launched a tweet and a facebook post after we set up an initial page where one could order some flowers; once you clicked on the order button, you got to a page where you got the reply: &#8220;You can not order at this time, please come back later.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #444444;"><span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;">This was picked up by a huge number of enthousiasts, and got retweeted multiple times. so we assumed we were on to something here&#8230; (f.e. in the first hour after our 2 tweets and facebook posts we had 100 visitors and some retweets), so we decided we were probably on to something good here.</span></span></p>
<h3><br /></h3>
<p><em style="color: #444444; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;"><img src="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/image.axd?picture=2012%2f7%2fblommekes-stats-day1.png" alt="" /></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #444444;"><span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;"><strong><em>We made our first mistakes here</em></strong></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #444444;"><span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;"><em>Visitors are not buyers; just because you are able to attract visitors does not mean you can get them to buy antyhing&#8230; Only about 10% clicked on the order button, and none of them on the pay button</em></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #444444;"><span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;"><em>As I had a history in sales, I somehow presumed we could use the slightly adjusted 1 to 18 ratio for conversion, so I assumed about 1 in 400 visitors would place an order (i.e. 1 in 20&sup2;); as we did not manage to get this conversion ratio, I presume we are lacking some things on our site, but more on that later&#8230;</em></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #444444;"><span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;"><em>We failed to collect data from those first time users; for example an email or something similar might have been a good idea.</em></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #444444;"><span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;"><em>Apparently once people had seen the site, they were not really keen to get back to it, because they knew what it was all about.&nbsp;</em></span></span></li>
</ul>
<h3>What was next</h3>
<p>We needed to get the following things working:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a flower shop willing to collaborate on this project</li>
<li>Make sure we are able to arrange the transportation for the flowers (both the delivery and the packaging)</li>
<li>Get the payment up and running</li>
<li>Have some online marketing</li>
<li>Try doing some offline marketing as well</li>
</ul>
<div>The first one was the easiest, as it was a win-win situation for both parties; no strings attached, so we found a local florist willing to help us really soon; I sold the idea on the first pitch.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The second one proved to be quite hard, as this was a completely new world for me; in the end we decided to go for our national postal service, and we found some clever ways to package our flowers to make sure they would remain fresh and in a good state during the transportation. This step also required me to order a minimum quantity of 100 boxes at a a price of 2.36&euro;/box; which is a lot for the packaging alone, but I did not want to be stuck with a thousand boxes if the startup failed.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Yet another lesson</em></strong></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>It is a whole different ballpark out there; for example ordering the boxes to late caused me to miss our first deadline by a day: Mother&#8217;s day&#8230;</em></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The payment was, quite frankly, a disaster. As we wanted to support a non-tech audience, we needed both VISA, MasterCard and direct bank payment support. After spending quite some time on getting A****Pay working, I tried the first real payment, and guess what happened:</div>
<h3><br /></h3>
<p><img src="https://twitpic.com/show/iphone/8h8t63" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After googling a bit for this, it turned out that this &#8220;temporary problem&#8221; was over 4 months old, and still was not fixed, so they basically fubarred me by not informing me.</p>
<p>So I decided to cut my losses, invest a steep startup cost in a well known payment provider, pay their monthly fee and also accept a high transaction cost from VISA, after all, we lost a lot of time on this&#8230;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Next lesson</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>When you have some momentum going; do not lose it. Do not go for the cheapest possible solution, but opt for established (but maybe more costly) options. In the end, choosing for cheap usually ends up in costing you more money after all. Never loose momentum, as this will cost you potential customers.</em></p>
<p>The online&nbsp;marketing was completely Pieter&#8217;s accomplishment, and I actually considered it to be quite good. However, it did not go viral, even though we wanted it to. Even though te reactions of the people were utterly positive, people did not share the link.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Another lesson</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Consider your target audience; people who tend to make things go viral, need something extraordinary they never saw before. While a lot of the people we targetted considered this something they never saw before, it never occured to them that they could actually share it in order to help us. Going viral is hard, and I presume it requires some real expertise and a lot of effort before you are able to create something like that on demand, a.k.a. &#8220;Hello Captain Obvious&#8221;.</em></p>

</object>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also decided to give&nbsp;offline marketing a shot, so Pieter ordered a thousand business cards, which we put about everywhere we managed to put them (i.e. restaurants, pubs, family spread them, &#8230;). The white on orange text underneath is unreadable due to the crappy webcam, but the text in white says &#8220;Geven &amp; Nemen&#8221;, which is Dutch for &#8220;Give &amp; Take&#8221;, which is intentionally somewhat interpretable in different ways&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="https://p.twimg.com/AnsgdVyCMAERCxS.png:large" alt="" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Here is another lesson</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>While it might be worthwile for some, spreading business cards everywhere was apparently not really worthwile for our specific kind of branche. I assume online services need online marketing, and breaching that boundary probably ends up costing you more then you gain.</em></p>
<h3>So we&nbsp;finally had everything in place</h3>
<p>One could order and pay flowers, we could transport them; our test shipment had proven to be excellent (i.e. tested in the most extreme possible way), So we were ready to go&#8230;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, nothing happened&#8230;</p>
<p>Absolutely nothing ? Well no, we got an order here and there, but nothing spectacular, so for now, the financial result of this whole experience is not exactly what we hoped it to be ** COUGH ** understatement ** COUGH **.</p>
<h3>Future evolution</h3>
<p>Is this the end of <a href="http://blommekes.be/" target="_blank">blommekes.be</a>? No, certainly not&#8230; We will try to adjust and improve our process in every way we can, even though this might be in small, gradual and incremental steps. We have made the initial effort, and as this was the first true startup, it was one hell of a ride&#8230;</p>
<p>As we are progressing with the other startups, we are learning valuable lessons, which we reapply to the previous startups as well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Another lesson</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Some things are obvious once they tell them to you, but can be missed quite easy, f.e. not showing the customer how they will be able to pay for their orders might actually hold them back completely.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Another obvious one is you need to have recurring customers. While a lot of the people I talked to seemed to know the site &#8220;Blommekes.be&#8221;, and considered it a great idea; most of them never really bothered to visit it again once they had seen it. We tried fixing it by adding a jokes section yesterday, but I am assuming I should probably give the possibility for the visitors to subscribe for an email, so <strong>here is my question to you: would you subscribe to a weekly email that shows you the new flower arrangement and possibly some new jokes that have been added, or not?</strong></em></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>While this whole thing has not exaclty been &#8220;a ride in the park&#8221;, we did make some actual progress, and got our first lessons in lean startups. As initially stated, we never assumed we would get it right the first time, the whole spirit of the &#8220;Project #Startup10&#8221;, is learning how to do a startup, so even though we have not been able to turn this into anything profitable (yet), we are making progress&#8230;</p>
<p>Whether or not blommekes.be will be a keeper, that is something&nbsp;only&nbsp;time will tell.</p>
<p>The reason I am sharing this, is because I am willing to learn from both my experiences and yours, so if you do have any tips, pointers, or even a simple &#8220;me too&#8221;, please mention this in the comments, as this is one of the things that motivate me to write these kind of posts&#8230;</p><div style="text-align:right"><a class="addthis_button" href="http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&amp;pub=xa-4aec37702e3161d4"><img src="http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-share-en.gif" width="125" height="16" alt="Bookmark and Share" style="border:0"/></a><script type="text/javascript" src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pub=xa-4aec37702e3161d4"></script></div>

		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>As most of you might know, I am currently in the process of improving the scalability of the <a href="http://www.paycento.com/" target="_blank">Paycento </a>backend..</p>
<p>As a real lean adept, the idea is to optimize where it hurts&#8230; As the creator of Node.js pointed out perfectly, the biggest pain is in the disk/network access etc.. Blocking threads hurt bigtime&#8230; So I started searching for easy low-cost optimizations that would not require to much effort&#8230;.</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Before we begin: Phase 0 - measuring=knowing; ask Heracles</h3>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent a big part of last month coding a command line app called &#8220;Heracles&#8221;, which is some kind of a helper app. It supports the following commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>checkout : downloads source and all solutions from SVN and puts them in the folders following our convention</li>
<li>build: builds all the source and publishes it to the publish &amp; publishweb folders</li>
<li>db: we have a &#8220;db drop xxx&#8221; and a &#8220;db restore xxx&#8221;, which downloads a backup from our ref db from the web and restores it in SQL Express..</li>
<li>install: this is a simple wrapper that invokes chocolatey or downloads installer packages from the web, so we all have the same dev environment. &#8220;Heracles install *&#8221; is all one needs to have all the required prerequisites</li>
<li>performancetest: restores the db, fires up the api WCF service with this db, fires up memcached and then runs all integration tests that have the category &#8220;integration&#8221; and &#8220;speed&#8221;. (simple MStest invoke, capturing relevant output). We redirect trace output to the console and append performance output in logs, so we have a log that contains every single performance test we ran&#8230;.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: left; ">This tool allows us to effectively measure our code adjustments in a few minutes, using two simple commands (&#8220;heracles build&#8221; and &#8220;heracles performancetest&#8221;).</div>
<div>This implies we can measure if our effort is actually resulting in some real improvements&#8230;</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>First things first: Caching</h3>
<p>The easiest way to speed up network/disk access, is simply avoiding it, so I started with caching the part that requires scalability&#8230;</p>
<p>Caching is an essential part of scalable websites, and there is no need to reinvent the wheel here&#8230; I started of with a simple static in-memory dictionary to verify my hunches, and then I started considering established options&#8230;&nbsp;After some reading up between different caching solutions, I found it hard to decide which option to select, but luckily I found the wonderfull <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/Glav.CacheAdapter" target="_blank">CacheAdapter written and maintained by Paul Glavich</a>. It allows you to switch between different caching types by altering web/app.config. The current cache options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>No cache</li>
<li>.Net 4.0 ObjectCache</li>
<li>Asp.Net Cache</li>
<li>Appfabric cache</li>
<li>Memcached</li>
</ul>
<p>This improved performance bigtime wiithout a lot of effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Up next: blocking IO requests hurt bigtime</h3>
<p>After considering the option to convert our WCF service into an async one (way to much effort for now), I discovered that one can easily improve performance of parallel requests by replacing simple calls with their async counterpart and just wait for them to complete&#8230;</p>
<p>I wrote a simple benchmark to download my homepage 20 times using async &amp; sync approaches, and the results were unbelievable:</p>
<p><strong><em>The async method was 28 times faster then the sync method&#8230;</em></strong></p>
<p>How does it work ?</p>
<p>It is actually quite simple; I wrote a little helper function in a static class called Wait.Async. Here is the complete sample code with the stats included, let us take a look first:</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2929935.js?file=asynctest.cs"></script>
</p>
<p>So, the code is really simple; I simple wait for the ResetEvent to be set&#8230; As this is quite repetetive code I wrote a little helper for it&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Can we use it to optimize database access ? Even Linq2SQL ?</h3>
<p>It is a little hackerisch for LinqToSQL and it has its limitations for the queries, but it is actually quite easy to do so&#8230; As we are a big fan of the community and like to give back, we offer you the code we use to improve LinqToSQL scalability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2929935.js?file=Paycento.API.Tasks.cs"></script>
</p>
<p>Unfortunately non-selects are AFAIK (close to) impossible to make async, so we currently simply opt to update the cached values directly and process the SQL on a background thread&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s up next ?</h3>
<p>For now, we have the tools and options in place to start optimizing the code&#8230; We applied the principles to 2 execution paths that require performance, and reached our initial performance goal. So now we need to optimize other paths as well. As my pseudo-fulltime consultancy period for Paycento is about to end next week, I can only assume it will be quite a busy week.. Fortunately, I will still be a member of the Paycento team, even though it will (for now) be more on an ad-hoc basis&#8230;</p><div style="text-align:right"><a class="addthis_button" href="http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&amp;pub=xa-4aec37702e3161d4"><img src="http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-share-en.gif" width="125" height="16" alt="Bookmark and Share" style="border:0"/></a><script type="text/javascript" src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pub=xa-4aec37702e3161d4"></script></div>

		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>As you might now <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/It-is-official-on-the-second-of-May-I-will-join-the-start-up-Paycento.aspx">I started working quite recently for the startup Paycento</a>. One of the things I am currently doing is setting up a system that allows us to do continuous integration and deployment everywhere and anywhere&#8230;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/ToJans">ToJans</a> Why write &amp; maintain it if someone already solved the problem? (assuming something solves it). Spend time on competitive adv :)</p>
&mdash; Simon Guindon (@simongui) <a href="https://twitter.com/simongui/status/203554104138670080">May 18, 2012</a></blockquote>
<p>
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
</p>
<p>As I got into an interesting discussion with Simon Guindon on twitter about the choice between a custom tool and an existing one like <a href="http://www.cruisecontrolnet.org/" target="_blank">CruiseControl.Net</a> for example, he suggested me to write a blog post about it. So here it is&#8230;</p>
<h3>You are suffering from the NIH (Not-Invented-Here) - syndrome!!</h3>
<p>So what! I get paid to write code, so I should not care what I write&#8230; or not ?</p>
<p>As a startup we have to make sure that everything we do provides business value, so why would one go to all this trouble to write his own CI/deployment system, if there are existing things available ?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Well, my friend, the argument is simple: as a startup, we have limited resources, and those do not include somebody who has either the time and the expertise to setup a full blown CI configuration. We tend to provide our time to features that actually provide value to the business.</p>
<p>By setting up a rudimentary c# app that pulls code from source control, copies some external dependencies and compiles the whole thing using simple MSBuild invokes, we have setup our very own CI server in just about an hour. (Removing and realigning all the dependencies so they matched all the required conventions took me a lot more time, but that is not really the point of discussion here)&#8230;</p>
<h3>Well, so you have now got a hard-coded build-package ? What happens if you need to change something ? You need to recompile it ??&nbsp;</h3>
<p>That, my friend, is exactly the idea. The people who will be deploying the app, will be the ones who write the code, so why add another extra layer/language if the target audience are devs anyway ? If deployment needs to be changed, this will have to be done by a coder, as I think the best way to feel responsibility for your changes is by making you the owner&#8230;</p>
<p>Will you be carefull when there is no extra layer of security between you and the world; would you be more motivated to add just that extra integration test on a feature you are not a 100% sure about? I am assuming you are, because when you deploy it, it is your responsibility if something goes wrong&#8230;.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/image.axd?picture=2012%2f5%2fpower.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is not a blog post about the why when and how of continuous integration/deployment, but I am assuming you get the picture here&#8230;</p>
<h3>What do you think a coder will say when you ask him to change this code ?</h3>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2727037.js?file=cruise.xml"></script>
</p>
<p>For the record: <a href="https://github.com/ccnet/CruiseControl.NET/blob/master/ccnet.build" target="_blank">this is the actual source from cruisecontrol.net</a>.</p>
<h3>Here is what the deployment looks like (for now) in our Heracles tool:</h3>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2727037.js?file=Program.cs"></script>
</p>
<p>I know which one I would pick&#8230;</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Sometimes it is good to take an existing tool and use it, but when you consider the long-term impact and dependency on such a tool, it might be better to consider your options very carefully before indulging in the next <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet" target="_blank">Silver Bullet</a>. In the end both Simon and I did agree that it is all about balance; the only thing I wanted to point out with this post is that one sometimes has to think before going down that familiar road.</p>
<h3>P.S. 3 extra reasons</h3>
<p>This approach also gives us the possibility that our CI can run anywhere (local/server/cloud), as long as MSBuild and .Net 4.0 are available. Heck, one might even support a *nix tool and support CI over amazon, but I am not going to spend my time right now in finding this out&#8230;&nbsp;We simply need to copy the exe and the dependencies, start it up and the rest works by itself&#8230; No need to walk through xxx install steps to setup a CI server here&#8230;</p>
<p>Another reason is actually even more important: having your integration &amp; deployment tool and configuration under source control really gives you a FULL view of your project&#8217;s history, especially in cloud-like environments this might be a big plus.</p>
<p>Finally, the last reason is the ease of setup for a new dev; whenever a new dev comes in, he just has to run the Heracles app, and he has all the right files in all the right places&#8230; fresh from the repository&#8230; and they build&#8230;</p>

		<h3>Finally !!</h3>
<p>It has been a while since I blogged about my <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Project-Startup10-Learning-to-build-your-own-business.aspx">project #startup10</a>, and there has been a reason for that&#8230; In the past months I have been talking quite a lot with a former colleague of mine, who co-founded a start-up, but on a whole different scale/level as <a href="http://blommekes.be/" target="_blank">my 2 utterly</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://dampen.be/" target="_blank">simple experiments</a>.</p>
<p>After having to keep my mouth shut for over a month - which was, as for those of you who know me, quite hard -, I am finally allowed to tell the world I am joining the start-up&nbsp;<a href="http://paycento.com/" target="_blank">www.paycento.com</a>&nbsp;.</p>

<h3>Paycento ? WHUT ? What&#8217;s that ?</h3>
<p>As it has been covered by international press, I will not try to write up my own version of the story, so I will refer you to some of the online press coverage:</p>

<h3><br /></h3>
<h3>What is your role there ?</h3>
<p>Simply put: all things software that are not front-end.&nbsp;Things will shape up as we progress, but as&nbsp;Paycento believes in the value of sharing knowledge, you can expect at least some blog posts about our experiences and findings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am aware that this assignment will be a huge challenge, but I am looking forward to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What does that imply for your project #Startup10 ?</h3>
<p>Since about a month ago project #startup10 has been put on temporary hold. I will still deliver the promised blog posts, but new startups will have to wait until a later/undetermined date. We are looking forward to sharing the Paycento experience with you !</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>TL;DR: I managed to minimize the CQRS overhead even further.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have been trying to minimize <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/?tag=/CQRS">CQRS in several iterations</a>, even releasing a framework and a lib in doing so. Yet, I have still not been satisfied by the approach I reached. This time I once again am pretty satisfied with the way things turned out, and they actually seem to require even way less overhead&#8230;</p>
<h3><br /></h3>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>The concept is quite simple: I use a generic message class to implement messaging. Next to this I use the virtual keyword:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>A class can contain virtual properties; these properties define the unique key of the instance. (f.e. an &#8220;Account&#8221; class has a &#8220;protected virtual string AccountId {get;set;}&#8221;).</li>
<li>When invoking a message on a class type, an instance is loaded where the unique key is loaded based on the match between the message parameters and the classes&#8217; virtual properties. A message only gets invoked if it contains all the virtual properties from the class.</li>
<li>In order to alter state, one should use a virtual method.</li>
<li>One can only send messages targetting non-virtual methods to a class instance.</li>
<li>Non-virtual methods should never alter state, but instead call a virtual method that alters the state&#8230;</li>
<li>When rebuilding state based on past events, only the messages targetting the virtual methods are invoked to rebuild the state; no messages are emitted.</li>
</ul>
<div>The advantage: all the wiring is convention-based; and once you get it it is quite easy: altering state should only happen through virtual methods, but these virtual methods should never contain any logic and just alter state or do nothing. The intercepted call to the virtual method gets emitted and gets processed by any non-virtual methods in other classes (if the message matches the classes&#8217; key).</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div></div>
<h3>Maybe an example can make it more clear</h3>

</p>
<p>As usual, the full source can be found <a href="https://github.com/ToJans/YakShayQRS/tree/RinatMode" target="_blank">over at github</a>.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This is yet another evolutionary approach to CQRS, and it feels pretty neat (event though the same things applied to the previous versions.

		<p>Note: this is a post from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Project-Startup10-Learning-to-build-your-own-business.aspx">a blog post series about starting up 10 businesses in a year</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I love <a href="https://appharbor.com/" target="_blank">appharbour</a>, in fact, I have 8 apps running over there at this moment. A little while ago, appharbour <a href="http://blog.appharbor.com/2012/02/02/announcing-pricing" target="_blank">announced that they now have to start making some money</a>, so that they were going to charge for custom hostnames&#8230;<br />I got a little dissapointed, since custom hostnames are an artificial limit, they do not add a lot of overhead to the system AFAIK, so why the hell would they charge for something like that??? I even was thinking about migrating my app to <a href="https://github.com/mauricemach/zappa" target="_blank">NodeJS, CoffeeScript and Zappa</a> and switching to <a href="http://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku </a>so I could have a free hostname, I even<a href="http://notanotherone.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"> set up a poc to check the feasibility</a>&#8230;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>So I would have to pay 10&euro;/month/site , and I do not have any profit yet&#8230;</h3>
<p>And I want to build <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Project-Startup10-Learning-to-build-your-own-business.aspx" target="_blank">10 different sites this year</a>, so I would have to pay 100&euro;/month just for custom hostnames, that is 1.2K&euro;/year; for that price I can get a lot of hosting&#8230; So I posted them this message, and they replied that I could find other hosting for this price, but the service would be different&#8230;</p>
<p>I could use options like<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_forwarding" target="_blank"> web forwarding</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaking" target="_blank">cloaking</a>, but this looks highly unprofessional&#8230; Maybe there are other alternatives ???</p>
<p>I decided to let this issue rest for a few weeks and progressed with my first two startups (<a href="http://blommekes.be/" target="_blank">blommekes.be</a> and <a href="http://dampen.be/" target="_blank">dampen.be</a>), updating them about umphteen times/day using a simple &#8220;git push apphb&#8221;&#8230; I could push fearlessly as I could just as easily revert to the previous version by the click of a mouse button&#8230; That is exactly one of the reasons I love it; they offer such a fine infrastructure&#8230; I even setup a simple staging environment by adding another apphb instance and a git remote&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Then I started thinking even more&#8230;</h3>
<p></p>
<p>After messing up 35&euro; and a lot of hours for MF*** Alertpay (which I&#8217;ll never ever use again for sure), I paid 300&euro; to activate an <a href="http://www.ogone.be/" target="_blank">Ogone</a> account. I now also pay a monthly fee of 65&euro; for their service&#8230; Next to this I pay 4% for all transactions over mastercard/amex/maestro credit cards&#8230; I ordered 100 cardboard boxes for blommekes.be at 2.36&euro; a piece&#8230; Why the hell was I making a fuss about 10&euro;/Month for a custom hostname&#8230;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Here&#8217;s the thing&#8230;.</h3>
<p>With my startups I would like to make money; the more the merrier&#8230; I assume the folks over at appharbour have the same goal. What was I making all this fuss about ? I presume I was expecting them to carry my investement on the web part, which is a bit unfair to be honest&#8230;</p>
<p><img style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial;" src="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/image.axd?picture=2012%2f2%2fapphb.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Their service is great, their product is great; for me, this service has been awesome&#8230; So I decided to put my money where my mouth is, and just pay the damn hostname forwarding&#8230; After all, what is 10 &euro;/month for their service; if I can not make 10&euro;/month profit for a website, I should probably shut it down anyway&#8230; Yes, I could do hosting for a cheaper amount, but that would mean I can not use all their infrastructure, and would probably have to manage the server myself etc&#8230;</p>
<p>As I was writing this article, I managed to fubar the <a href="http://blommekes.be" target="_blank">blommekes.be</a> instance, but <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/troethom/status/174877146613956608" target="_blank">they replied over twitter within a few minutes; great support !!</a></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Free is great, but sometimes one has to realize that not all things can be free; everybody has to make a living, so it is quite natural people charge you for what they do&#8230;.. Sometimes one has to step back and pay for the service&#8230; If every apphb member is a freeloader, their service would probably not last long. I now happily pay the 10&euro;/month per site, and hope others will do to, so their product will stay available as their service offers great value to me&#8230;.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I love reading about startups, lean product development, software practices etc&#8230; After spending over a decade studying a plaethora of subjects, I decided to finally put my money where my mouth is: this year I am going to put the theory in practice, and start up 10 new (or not so new, but different) business ideas, hence the tag #Startup10.</p>
<p>In the first post of this series I will give you a primer on my background, and also a few pointers to the things that inspire and motivate me; I hope they might inspire you too&#8230;</p>
<h3>The&nbsp;**drumroll** &#8220;Big Idea&#8221; about a decade ago</h3>
<p>The first thing I decided to build when I decided to quit my day job about a decade ago, was a single software product that would allow me to apply it to all kind of different problem domains, it required me to setup the database, and do little or no&nbsp;extra&nbsp;custom development. Little did I know that the software part was the least important of all&#8230;</p>
<p>Even though I did manage to sell a few user licenses at 1.5K, <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Cudi-Core-universal-database-interface.aspx">the product</a> never really hit the market bigtime; here is why: I did not have a clue who my target audience was, so I had no idea how to market the product.</p>
<p>While the product in itself was not that bad, it was obvious that it was not going to allow me to make a living out of it, so I opted for the path most ICT-people opt: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/tomjanssens" target="_blank">freelance consultancy</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>So one could say that this was actually my first startup attempt&#8230;.</p>
<h3>Enter 10 years later&#8230;. Project #Startup10</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Over the years and multiple consultancy jobs later, my understanding evolved (even after building my first product, check <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/CROAM-objective-analysis.aspx" target="_blank">this post from 2004</a>), and I found out that <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/?tag=/BDD" target="_blank">modelling software around behavior instead of data</a> usually results in way better software.</p>
<p>However, this fact is not as important as one would think&#8230; My biggest failure at the time, was building a product without even knowing what my target audience was and how I would market it &#8230;</p>
<p>After 10 years of reading about startups and business, I decided to verify whether all my newly acquired knowledge made any sense, so two months ago (Januari 2012) I decided to take a few months off before getting back to consultancy, get a few startups up and running, and continuing on the next ones while doing some freelance consultancy on the side<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/tomjanssens" target="_blank">(I am for rent by the way)</a>&#8230;.</p>
<p>I am now two months in, the two sites are up and fully functional, and we are ready to launch the first two onto the Belgian market (more in later posts):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://Blommekes.be" target="_blank">http://Blommekes.be</a> : Order flowers online in a few clicks and make your mrs. happy (after you blew some of your points).</li>
<li><a href="http://Dampen.be" target="_blank">http://Dampen.be</a> : Smoking without tar and nicotine</li>
</ul>
<div>I will discuss these two in detail in later posts in these series, but for now I can tell that I really hated and enjoyed setting them up. I know the description of both might sound a little bland, but I honestly think we might actually have a chance here&#8230;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>In case you want to place an order; please do. The only thing that&#8217;s on our todo list now, is marketing the sites and generating some volume, which I will blog about later on.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<h3>This blog post was going to mention something about inspiration and motivation ?</h3>
<p>Actually, there are a few relevant posts that inspired me for Project #Startup10; without further ado, here are some of my favorite articles/posts:</p>
<h4><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/12/the-difference-between-a-failure-and-a-mistake.html" target="_blank">The difference between a failure and a mistake - Seth Godin</a></h4>
<p>This was the short blurb that actually triggered me to get started with the project #StartUp10. Seth is stating in this post that one can try and do stuff, and as long as you are learning from it the outcome is not all that important. The most important thing, is that you learn from your failure and avoid making a mistake&#8230;</p>
<p>Failure is part of the learning process iteration: have an idea, implement the absolute minimum, measure and evolve from there&#8230; Do not be afraid of failure !!</p>
<p>That is why I set up #Startup10: instead of putting all my money in one basket, I assume most (if not all) my startup attempts will fail, but I hope I will learn something during the process.</p>
<h4><a href="http://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/" target="_blank"><strong>1.0 is the loneliest number - Matt Mullenweg</strong></a></h4>
<p>This is an essay where Matt describes what it is like when you build a product; there is one absolutely fabulous quote in there that I mention to everyone:</p>
<blockquote><em>if you&rsquo;re not embarrassed when you ship your first version you waited too long.</em></blockquote>
<p>This makes a lot of sense, but is hard to follow; most people have big plans, but as long as you do not have paying customers your project is worthless; get money out of it ASAP. Most of my ambitious projects die of feature creep&#8230; So now I start small&#8230;</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.andrewfashion.com/2009/12/05/how-i-made-2-5-million/" target="_blank">Young &amp; stupid: How I Made 2.5 Million - Andrew Fashion</a></h4>
<p>Another great post, this time by someone who has been &#8220;entrepreneur&#8221;- ing ever since the 6th grade&#8230; I would like to suggest you to read the whole Young &amp; Stupid series, as they are a really interesting read&#8230; Somehow this blog post series was one of the first ones that actually convinced me great things can be achieved when you put your mind to it, but it also clarified that one should take nothing for granted, i.e. easy come = easy go&#8230;</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/three_hund_million_button/" target="_blank">The $300 Million Button - UIE.COM - Jared M. Spool</a></h4>
<p>This is one great article about how there might be a lot of opportunity by *really* thinking things through. By making the login process optional when ordering a basket - &#8220;I am not here to build a relationship&#8221; -, the sales increased by $3,000,000 / year.</p>
<p>That is actually one of the reasons we started with <a href="http://Blommekes.be" target="_blank">http://Blommekes.be</a> : people are not here to browse all different kind of flowers and configure a pleathora of options, they just want to order some to make the Mrs. happy, so we made this as convenient as we possibly could: pick your flower, type the message for the attached card and the adress, and just pay; nothing more, nothing less. (We applied the same principle to <a href="http://dampen.be" target="_blank">http://dampen.be</a> as well).</p>
<h4><a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/" target="_blank">Getting Real - 37 Signals</a></h4>
<p>This is a full E-book (also availble as a paperback) that describes exactly how the lean approach might work in software. It is a great read, and it is incredible this is a free book. Read it and learn; there is a tremendous amount of value in there&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>These links are only an excerpt, but they should get you started&#8230; As time progresses I might add some extra links, but for now this will have to suffice&#8230;</p>
<p>In the next post, I will talk about how one gets ideas for a startup. Please note that the #Startup10 Project is a work in progress, so I might actually fall flat on my face and fail miserably. But hey, at least I will have these posts to fall back to, so I can avoid making mistakes&#8230;</p>
<p>If you are active in a startup, or this article somehow inspires you, let me know in the comments.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I was in an environment where I only had SQL Server available, but I really wanted a key-value store, so what did I do:</p>
<h3>Use SQL Server as a Key-Value store - Major Haxxors</h3>
<p>In order to be a proper key-valuestore, one would need to add the ability to do searching etc, but as this was only a quick hack where I did not require the search, I did not implement it.</p>
<p>In case I would have implemented a search, I probably would have used something like <a href="https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch" target="_blank">Elastic Search</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1892554.js?file=KeyValueStore.cs"></script>
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>While this approach is probably not advisable, it helped my to resolve my issue in a very short time. The biggest effort was in getting the upsert command correct. Do not hold me responsible if you use this in a production environment and it blows up on you!!</p><div style="text-align:right"><a class="addthis_button" href="http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&amp;pub=xa-4aec37702e3161d4"><img src="http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-share-en.gif" width="125" height="16" alt="Bookmark and Share" style="border:0"/></a><script type="text/javascript" src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pub=xa-4aec37702e3161d4"></script></div>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I <a href="http://www.visug.be/Eventdetails/tabid/95/EventId/54/Default.aspx" target="_blank">am presenting for Visug on the 6th of march</a>; it is a session about CQRS; here is the abstract:</p>
<hr />
<h3>CQRS 101 - All Your BASE Belong To Us</h3>
<p>CQRS is a relatively new approach to software development in complex, distributed and/or asynchronous problem domains.</p>
<p>In the first part of this session, you will get a brief but pragmatic overview on the what, why and when using some examples. You will see how CQRS leverages BASE in CAP-theorem, and how this translates to the cloud. We will also touch some of the major advantages and disadvantages of this pattern, including applicability to TDD/BDD and NoSQL-like environments.</p>
<p>In the second part we will get our hands dirty by implementing some sample domain behavior, using one of the many possible CQRS approaches. You will see how CQRS really separates business logic from infrastructure, and that infrastructure in itself is practically interchangeable. Next to this you will also see how the combination with eventsourcing allows you to completely remodel historic data without a lot of effort.</p>
<p>Before the Q&amp;A starts we will end with a small overview of the session, together with some practical tips on how you might use this approach today.</p>
<hr />
<p>Unfortunately the session is sold out, but hey, if it is a success, I am confident more of them will follow&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>The presentation is over; 45 people; a great crowd and lots of interaction&#8230;.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/image.axd?picture=2012%2f3%2fvisug.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>While I covered quite a lot of ground, I think the biggest remark was to show more concrete examples; you can find the slides <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/pub?id=157NwGxUZY_PKW0H_R_jjA3zLZkYiheuQfyh60IU0PrE&amp;start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/ToJans/CQRS-101-code" target="_blank">published the (cleaned up and bugfixed) example sourcecode on github</a>.</p>
<p>Feedback/tips/Remarks ? Please let me know your opinions in the comments, so I can improve it!</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Over at a <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?about=&amp;gid=95341" target="_blank">private LinkedIn newsgroup for ENTP personality types</a>, somebody posted a link to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2012/01/02/the-seven-habits-of-spectacularly-unsuccessful-executives/" target="_blank">&#8220;The Seven Habits of Spectacularly unsuccessful Executives&#8221;</a>. This is a great article, but not a lot of help IMO, instead of telling what not to do, one might be reversing the reasoning, and try to figure out what to do.</p>
<p>I posted this blurb in a comment on the newsgroup, and I figured I might as well post it on the blog as well&#8230;</p>
<p>Here we go:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Seven Habits of Possibly Spectacularly Successful Executives</h3>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#1: Look and interpret the market, you do not control the market, but have to follow it and adapt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>#2: The project is not an extension of yourself; take some distance and try to be objective. Do not spam your personal peers&#8230;</p>
<p>#3: Learn all the time: observe, measure, adjust &amp; iterate&nbsp;</p>
<p>#4: Positive reviews are great, but it&#8217;s the negative reviews that enable you to become better&nbsp;</p>
<p>#5: Image is important, but your business is even more important; do not spend all your time on PR, but ship instead&nbsp;</p>
<p>#6: Admit it when you are wrong&nbsp;</p>
<p>#7: What worked in the past might not work in the future&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Looking back at these rules it is obvious:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix" target="_blank"> the four marketing P&#8217;s (Product, Price, Placement, Promotion)</a> have to iterate a lot faster. A product is no longer in a solid state, but in a coninuous process of improvement.</p>
<p>To some of you who know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Startup" target="_blank">the lean startup approach</a> these habits might sound obvious, but for others it might sound new: the idea is to market your product as soon as possible (even sometimes before you have an actual product), measure the customer&#8217;s reaction, re-evaluate and iterate&#8230; The iteration process has to be very short and agile, so you work in small incremental steps (opposed to the usual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front" target="_blank">BDUF </a>approach)</p>
<p>I think this might be one of the biggest paradigm shifts of the century: the speed by which a product evolves&#8230;</p>
<p>If you are interested in the lean approach, I might suggest you to subscribe for the free online course <a href="http://www.launchpad-class.org/" target="_blank">&#8220;The Lean Launchpad&#8221;</a>&nbsp;that starts in februari over at Stanford University, I know I did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Signing off,</p>

		<p>It has been a while, but I finally managed to push a major upgrade to MvcExtensions; this is the change list:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Upgraded spark for MVC RC2<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + Extra string operators for MyText<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + Added abstract model for Joe Celko&#8217;s NestedSet<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + Added Dynamic SQL (text sorts etc)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + Added HttpContextBoundObject<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Improved &amp; extended FluentNhibernate/Database<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + Added Fluentnhibernate TextAlteration for mytext field length in db<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Improved SetCultureLanguageAttribute<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + Added a class SetCultureHelper for temporary changing language<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + Added IEnumerableHelper extensions for Page &amp; Paging<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + Added helper for building jQuery jqGrid models<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Bugfixed MyTextModelBinder<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Improved MvcExtensionsModule</p>
<p>This application framework has allready been used for 2 custom customer applications, and I have to say that it made my development quite successfull.</p>
<p>I have to admit that the documentation is still lacking a lot, but there is a sample project included.</p>

		<h3>Introduction<br /></h3>
<p>Today I was reading an <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/library/simpleservicelocator.aspx" target="_blank">article on Codeproject</a>, and I was really astounded by the way some people rate articles and give comments&#8230;</p>
<p>It was an article about someone who had implemented a simple service locator which contained the following code sample :</p>
<p><div class="code">
<br /><span class="kwrd">using</span> System; <br /><span class="kwrd">using</span> CuttingEdge.ServiceLocation; <br /><span class="kwrd">using</span> Microsoft.Practices.ServiceLocation;  <br /><br /><span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Global : System.Web.HttpApplication <br />{<br />&nbsp; <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Application_Start(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)     <br />&nbsp; {         <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // 1. Create a <span class="kwrd">new</span> Simple Service Locator container         <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var container = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SimpleServiceLocator();                  <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // 2. Configure the container                  <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Register a <span class="kwrd">delegate</span> that will create a <span class="kwrd">new</span>         <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // instance on each call to GetInstance.         <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; container.Register&lt;ISamurai(() =&gt;          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {             <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var weapon = ServiceLocator.Current                 .GetInstance();             <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> Samurai(weapon);         <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; });              <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Register a single <span class="kwrd">object</span> instance that always         <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // be returned (must be thread-safe).         <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; container.RegisterSingle(<span class="kwrd">new</span> Katana());              <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // 3. Register the container to the Common Locator         <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ServiceLocator.SetLocatorProvider(() =&gt; container);     <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } <br />}<br /></div></p>
<p>Which seems quite obvious to me. Since I noticed a <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/library/simpleservicelocator.aspx?msg=3420815#xx3420815xx" target="_blank">comment titled &#8216;my vote of 2&#8217;</a>, I was curious why this article would be voted such a low score (2 out of 5). I checked the comment and I was astounded:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Please note: the keyword &#8220;var&#8221; is supposed to be used with anonymous types. You should not use it for anything else. Otherweise please start <br />programming java script</em></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Who cares ?<br /></h3>
<p>Actually, I do.</p>
<p>Since I could not resist I posted the following comment:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Ahum&#8230; there have been numerous issues about this, but in general it should not pose a problem, because it is quite clear what it&#8217;s intentions are at the beginning; i.e. :<br /><br /><div class="code">
var sl = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SimpleServiceLocator();</div><br /><br /><br />Is not really more obvious then :<br /><br /><div class="code">
SimpleServiceLocator sl = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SimpleServiceLocator();</div><br /><br /><br />In fact, the information in there is the same, but the second one is more verbose, so every person in his right mind would opt for the first alternative.<br />This might be different if you use a function which does not directly expose the return type in the function name; i.e. :<br /><br /><div class="code">
var x = SomeFunction(y,z); </div><br /><br /><br />This is considered bad practice by most.<br /><br />This one is not :<br /><br /><div class="code">
var myservice = sl.Resolve&lt;IMyService&gt;();</div><br /><br /><br />Because the initialization contains enough obvious info to give pointers to the var&#8217;s type.<br /><br />So, if this is the only reason why you are giving a 2 (the author has obviously invested quite some time in this article), then you might need to start doing some JavaScript yourself </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>After tweeting about this, I had an interesting conversation with <a href="http://twitter.com/JacoPretorius" target="_blank">@JacoPretorious</a> about this, who says he uses var everywhere, but pays more attention to variable names.</p>
<p>While I understand what he means, IMHO variable names should not infer the type, only the meaning of the content if necessary.</p>
<p>I personally think there is nothing wrong with using single letters as variable names, as long as the intent is obvious. This is an example that is perfectly valid imho :</p>
<p><div class="code">
<br /><span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> InvalidateCustomer(<span class="kwrd">int</span> CustomerId)<br />{<br />&nbsp; var c = sRepo.GetById&lt;Customer&gt;(CustomerId);<br />&nbsp; <span class="kwrd">if</span> ( c.Orders.Where(o=&gt;o.PaymentReceivedOn==<span class="kwrd">null</span>).Any()) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">false</span>;<br />&nbsp; c.Valid=<span class="kwrd">false</span>;<br />&nbsp; sRepo.SaveOrUpdate(c);<br />&nbsp; sUOW.Commit();<br />&nbsp; <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">true</span>;<br />}<br /></div></p>
<p>This one is not IMO :</p>
<p><div class="code">
<br /><span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MyProcessQueue<br />{<br />&nbsp; <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ProcessQueue()<br />&nbsp; {</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="kwrd">for</span>(;;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var p = Queue.Next();<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="kwrd">if</span> (p==<span class="kwrd">null</span>) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="kwrd">break</span>;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sProcessor.Process(p);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />&nbsp; }<br />}<br /></div></p>
<p>Since you can not infer the type from <strong>Queue</strong>, you should make the type explicit :</p>
<p><div class="code">
<br /> <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MyProcessQueue<br /> {</p>
<p>&nbsp; <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ProcessQueue()<br /> &nbsp; {</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="kwrd">for</span>(;;)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; {<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order o = Queue.Next();<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="kwrd">if</span> (o==<span class="kwrd">null</span>) <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="kwrd">break</span>;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sProcessor.Process(o);<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br /> &nbsp; }<br /> }<br /> </div></p>
<p><br />This would change if the <strong>MyProcessQueue</strong> would be a generic class :</p>
<p><div class="code">
<br /> <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MyProcessQueue&lt;T&gt; <span class="kwrd">where</span> T:ISomeInterface<br /> {<br /> &nbsp; <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ProcessQueue()<br /> &nbsp; {</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="kwrd">for</span>(;;)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; {<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var p = Queue.Next();<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="kwrd">if</span> (p==<span class="kwrd">null</span>) <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="kwrd">break</span>;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sService.Process(p);<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br /> &nbsp; }<br /> }<br /> </div><br /><br />In this case, I think you have enough information available to know that the type should be about the generic class. Using more explicit names for the variables does not add a lot info for me; I do not find the following (exagerated) example more abvious than the previous one; in fact, it takes more time to get the intent here, because your mind needs to process more information (also note the comments, which do not provide any extra info to me) :</p>
<p><div class="code">
<br /><span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MyProcessQueue&lt;T&gt;<br /> &nbsp; <span class="kwrd">where</span> T:ISomeInterface<br />{&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <span class="rem">// Process all jobs in the queue, until there is nothing left&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; public void ProcessAllISomeInterfacesInTheQueue()<br />&nbsp; { <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // loop forever <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; for(;;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // get the next instance to process from the queue;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // if it returns null there are no more processes left on the queue&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ISomeInterface TheNextISomeInterfaceInstanceToProcess = Queue.Next();</p></span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="kwrd">if</span> (TheNextISomeInterfaceInstanceToProcess==<span class="kwrd">null</span>)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //exit the infinite loop&nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="kwrd">break</span>;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // process it&nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sServiceThatProcessesSomeInterfaceInstance<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Process(TheNextISomeInterfaceInstanceToProcess);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // go to the next one<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; // <span class="kwrd">return</span>&nbsp; <br /> &nbsp; }<br /> }<br /> </div></p>
<p>There is way too much info here which can all be easily derived from the code, and if you change the code and forget the comments, this might actually do the opposite: cause confusion.</p>
<h3>In conclusion</h3>
<p>While this is all about preference and highly dependent on you point of view and background, I do think that the approach I am personnaly using is one of the better ones. They offer all the amount of information that you could need with the minimum amount of code.</p>
<p>If you do have another opinion, do not hesitate to let me know&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h3>Introduction<br /></h3>
<p>This is my first screencast for my <a href="http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions" target="_blank">MVCExtensions project</a>, it shows you how to get started and build a simple tasklist.</p>
<p>PS: This is the direct link to the powerpoint used:<br /> <a href="http://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dgt3mk3c_6fmhrd9c5">http://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dgt3mk3c_6fmhrd9c5</a></p>
<h3>Some background info</h3>
<p>This was my first screencast, and it took me about 7 attempts to finally get it to a point where it was more or less acceptable. For my sixth and seventh attempt I finally found some good screencap software : <a href="http://www.bbsoftware.co.uk/bbflashbackexpress/home.aspx?app=FBExpress2&amp;did=-1&amp;rid=0&amp;cc=true" target="_blank">BBFlashback Express</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, this has been an interesting experience, and now enjoy mvcextensions !!!</p>

		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>After reading <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2010/01/24/a-train-of-thought-january-2010-edition.aspx" target="_blank">the latest post</a> from <a href="http://twitter.com/JeremyDMiller" target="_blank">@jeremydmiller</a> I felt the urge to write a small article about the BDD part since there might be missing a vital part here about BDD&#8230;</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What is true BDD ?</h3>
<p>For a general introduction on BDD I would like to refer you to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_driven_development">wikipedia</a>. There are also a lot of <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/?tag=/bdd">articles on this blog on specific issues as well</a>.</p>
<p>Just to get an idea I&#8217;ll show you an excerpt of a spec (taken from <a href="http://github.com/ToJans/Aubergine/blob/master/Be.Corebvba.Aubergine.Examples/Website/Stories/Make_sure_my_Website_gets_enough_traffic.txt" target="_blank">here</a>):</p>

<p>Each time I compile my application, these specs get executed, and I get <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/simpletasklist/Content/output.html">a report about which specs fail and which specs succeed</a>, so you customer knows which functionalities are working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a true bdd engine specs are written using an intermediate language (a.k.a. <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/node/132" target="_blank">ubiquitous language</a>).<br />The biggest advantage of this extra layer is that it makes your specs completely independent from your design/infrastructure implementation.</p>
<p>This also implies that I personally do not consider engines that require writing your specs in code (like <a href="http://twitter.com/aaronjensen" target="_blank">@aaronjensen</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://github.com/machine/machine.specifications" target="_blank">mspec</a> for example) as true BDD engines. (Please do note that this is my personal opinion)</p>
<h3>Why is that an advantage ?</h3>
<p>The first advantage is that this domain language is usable/understandable by domain experts as well. All you have to do is send them a link to the latest build bdd html report, and they know what to expect from your app&#8230; <br />Given you explain the available grammar for a context to a domain expert he/she should even be able to write their own scenario&#8217;s. (Hence, my bdd engine has a commandline option to get the available grammar from a context DLL, so in theory you could send the compiled DLL to the domain expert and let him/her write the specs)</p>
<p>The second one is a bit less obvious, and is why one requires the ubiqutous langugage in a true BDD engine: since behaviour almost never changes, you can simply replace complete parts of an application without having to rewrite your specs. Instead of fixing tests you only need to fix your contexts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>You never have to rewrite your specs, since the bevaviour does not change, it&#8217;s only the implementation that does</strong></p>
<p>Fixing context implementations is a usually less work compared to rewriting tests since a test usually contains some/a lot of dependencies in comparision to a single sentence of context grammar (which typically handles only a single dependency).</p>
<p>As an example I am giving this anology : if behavioural tests would be an app written using an ioc container and dependency injection principles, then unit tests would be an app written without them.</p>
<p>If you apply bdd-like practices to tdd (also known as <a href="http://agileinaflash.blogspot.com/2009/03/arrange-act-assert.html" target="_blank">Arrange/Act/Assert</a>) you are missing out on a large part of BDD imho; it is like writing your apps using dependency injection, but without using a container: it works and it makes your code better, but you could make your life a lot easier if you would use a container.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Another advantage: refactoring<br /></h3>
<p>Another huge advantage that I initially missed in my reflections on BDD, is even more important:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>By defining your behaviour before writing a single line of code, both you and the domain experts can think your app through upfront, and refactor at will<br /></strong></p>
<p>Think about this a little bit. Usually you have a certain idea about how an app is supposed to behave. Your customer has this idea as well, but the problem might be that the customer&#8217;s ideas are different from your&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Bij defining the behavior of the app explicitly in BDD specs, you rule out a lot of the (rather frustrating) refactorings due to misinterpretations, since the possible mismatch between different interpretations is closer to zero.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I have been refactoring a BDD story over and over during a whole week together with a domain expert, and the end result was that we managed to switch from umphteen screens to only 3; this was a huge win, since we did not only have less UI to implement, but the whole process became a lot simpler for the user !!!</p>
<h3><br /></h3>
<h3>Finally</h3>
<p>Whether you *do* start using BDD is completely up to you. As you might know, there is no silver bullet, but it might be a tool that helps a little.</p>
<p>In my personal experiences opinion BDD is currently the way to go; but I might be a bit opinionated, since I have been dogfooding <a href="http://agileinaflash.blogspot.com/2009/03/arrange-act-assert.html" target="_blank">my own BDD engine</a> for a few months now&#8230;</p>
<p>And for those of you why think I am suffering from the &#8220;Not-invented-here&#8221;-syndrome, you are probably right - although I have written an <a href="http://wiki.github.com/ToJans/Aubergine/the_aubergine_design_manifest" target="_blank">Aubergine manifest</a> to explain why we needed another bdd engine- .</p>
<p>Happy development !!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h3>Introduction<br /></h3>
<p>Today I finished v0.4 of my MVCExtensions library and <a title="Source on github" href="http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions/archives/master" target="_blank">I pushed the sourcecode to github</a>.</p>
<p>I also included a very simple tasklist, in order to show you on how to get started using this library. You can also see (slightly outdated) example code in <a title="Teaser on my upcoming mvcextensions project release" href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Teaser-on-my-upcoming-mvcextensions-project-release.aspx">this blog post</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>You can see a demo of the tasklist app running <a title="Simple task list demo app" href="http://www.corebvba.be/simpletasklist/home.aspx">here</a>. (Try entering a task without a name, or with a name that has more then 256 chars to see the custom strings in action).</p>
<p>You can download the full sourcecode <a title="Full sourcecode zip/tar" href="http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions/archives/master" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>I now made a screencast as well. it is available <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Screencast-Build-an-Aspnet-MVC-application-quickly-using-MVCExtensions.aspx">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What is MvcExtensions ?<br /></h3>
<p>It is a library I wrote that takes out the burden of setting up a new MVC app each time. It was developed in order to be able to deliver apps faster to my customers&#8230;</p>
<p>In order to set it up, you need to <a href="http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions/blob/master/src/Tasks.Core/Services/TaskDatabaseFluentMapping.cs" target="_blank">create a class that defines where your domain model objects are</a>, and <a href="http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions/blob/master/src/Tasks.UI.Web/Global.asax.cs" target="_blank">register the module in global.asax</a>. That&#8217;s it !!!<br />The library auto-wires asp.net mvc with <a title="Castle.Windsor getting started" href="http://www.castleproject.org/container/gettingstarted/index.html" target="_blank">castle.windsor</a> IOC, <a href="http://twitter.com/JBogard" target="_blank">@jbogard&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/archive/2009/01/22/automapper-the-object-object-mapper.aspx" target="_blank">Automapper</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/Jagregory" target="_blank">@jagregory</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org/" target="_blank">FluentNHibernate </a>ORM, <a href="http://twitter.com/LouDeJ" target="_blank">@Loudej</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://sparkviewengine.com/" target="_blank">Spark viewengine</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/JeremySkinner">@JeremySkinner</a>&#8217;s <a title="Mvccontrib home" href="http://mvccontrib.org/" target="_blank">MvcContrib</a> and some custom extensions. The idea is that the library takes all the hassle out of the setup of an asp.net MVC app and their dependencies&#8230;</p>
<p>It should also be pretty well structured using <a href="http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions/tree/master/src/MvcExtensions/Services/" target="_blank">Services</a>/<a href="http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions/blob/master/src/MvcExtensions/Services/Impl/FluentNHibernate/Repository.cs" target="_blank">Generic repository</a>, <a href="http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions/tree/master/src/Tasks.Core/Model/" target="_blank">Model</a>-<a href="http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions/tree/master/src/Tasks.UI.Web/Views" target="_blank">View</a>-<a href="http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions/tree/master/src/Tasks.UI.ViewModels/Home/" target="_blank">Viewmodels</a>, &#8230;<br />It also has a few <a href="http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions/blob/master/src/MvcExtensions/Model/MyText.cs" target="_blank">predefined string classes with fixed length/null-&amp; regex checkers for validation as well,</a> controller action links<a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/M-V-VM-in-AspNet-MVC-removing-dependencies-between-asp-Net-views-and-controller-actions.aspx" target="_blank"> that are defined in the controller instead of in the view</a>, &#8230;</p>
<p>This should allow you to write <a href="http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions/blob/master/src/Tasks.Core/Controllers/HomeController.cs" target="_blank">very clean controllers</a> as well with <a href="http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions/blob/master/src/Tasks.Core/Controllers/HomeContainer.cs" target="_blank">custom automappers injected into the controller</a>.</p>
<p>It also contains<a href="http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions/tree/master/src/MvcExtensions/UI/Web/View/" target="_blank"> 3 spark extensions</a> for the spark view engine in order to render <a href="http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions/tree/master/src/MvcExtensions/UI/ViewModel/" target="_blank">actionlinks </a>without <a href="http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions/blob/master/src/Tasks.UI.Web/Views/Home/Index.spark" target="_blank">much hassle</a>.</p>
<h3>Some Aubergine BDD as well<br /></h3>
<p>Next to this it also contains a  <a href="http://twitter.com/tojans" target="_blank">@tojans</a> <a title="Aubergine on github" href="http://github.com/ToJans/Aubergine" target="_blank">Aubergine</a> BDD&nbsp;<img title="Cool" src="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/editors/tiny_mce3/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-cool.gif" border="0" alt="Cool" />project with <a title="The specs (tm) ;)" href="http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions/blob/master/src/Tasks.Specs/Stories/TaskStories.txt" target="_blank">specs</a> and a <a title="The context class" href="http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions/blob/master/src/Tasks.Specs/TaskContext.cs" target="_blank">context</a>.</p>

<br /></div></div>
<p>The specs project generates and shows this <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/simpletasklist/Content/output.html" target="_blank">report</a> whenever it gets built (unless you introduce a bug).</p>
<h3>What should I do with it ?</h3>
<p>Well, I would suggest you to check it out, and try to create a small demo app using the mvcextensions lib.</p>
<p>You can download all the required binaries from a single zip <a href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/ToJans/MVCExtensions/MvcExtensions_2010_01_21_with_all_the_needed_DLL_s.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p>I will probably create a walkthrough and/or screencast later on how to do this, unless somebody beats me to it&#8230; In case you would like me to show you a demo,<strong> do let me know what kind of app you would like to see.</strong> <br />Do not forget that it should be relatively limited on the functionality side in order to implement it in a short demo&#8230;</p>
<p>Opinions are appreciated !!</p>
<p>And as always : enjoy !!!</p><div style="text-align:right"><a class="addthis_button" href="http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&amp;pub=xa-4aec37702e3161d4"><img src="http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-share-en.gif" width="125" height="16" alt="Bookmark and Share" style="border:0"/></a><script type="text/javascript" src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pub=xa-4aec37702e3161d4"></script></div>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I am going to give you a quick teaser on how to setup a full asp.net mvc application with database &amp; all the rest using my soon-to-be-updated MVCExtensions library.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Take the following steps :</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new asp.net MVC project</li>
<li>Add a reference to the MVCExtensions DLL and it&#8217;s dependencies</li>
<li>Create your model <br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/280330.js?file=Task.cs"></script>
</li>
<li>Create your database mappings <br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/280330.js?file=TaskDatabaseFluentMapping.cs"></script>
</li>
<li>Create your viewmodels<br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/280330.js?file=VMIndex.cs"></script>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/280330.js?file=VMEdit.cs"></script>
</li>
<li>Create your views<br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/280330.js?file=application.spark.html"></script>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/280330.js?file=index.spark.html"></script>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/280330.js?file=edit.spark.html"></script>
</li>
<li>Create your controller<br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/280330.js?file=HomeController.cs"></script>
</li>
<li>Create your custom childcontainer for the homecontroller<br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/280330.js?file=homecontainer.cs"></script>
</li>
<li>Wire up everything in global.asax
<script src="http://gist.github.com/280330.js?file=AAAA_global.asax.cs"></script>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That is all there is to it; you now have a fully functional ASP.Net MVC application that  uses Castle.Windsor IOC/Automapper/Spark viewengine with al_a and al_form support !!!</p>
<p>I still have a few things to finish first (namely the string1024 and memofields need custom Modelbinders in order to mimic a string type), but as soon as I implemented those I can push everything to <a href="http://github.com/ToJans/MVCExtensions"> this github repository</a></p>
<p>Enjoy !!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In the past I have noticed a lot of people talk about (special) relativity and other physics theories, but when you ask them a few questions, they do not seem to grasp the concept&#8230;.</p>
<p>In this series of blog posts I will try to explain you some of his concepts the way I understand them&#8230;</p>
<p>The inspiration for this series has been one of Einstein&#8217;s quotes :</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler&#8221;</p>
<p>I am no physicist by any means, nor a good mathematician, so you should never ask me any questions about the proof or maths about something, since I simply do not know. If you ask most people about these theories they usually start making it way too complicated for one of the two following reasons :</p>
<ul>
<li>They do not understand it, so they try to blow you away with complicated things they heard about it, so you would stop asking questions about it&#8230;</li>
<li>They do understand it, but their explanation assumes you know the &#8220;language of physicists&#8221; - which you do not - so it seems like they are talking Jibberish all the way&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>We will start with a very popular concept : the theory of special relativity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Special Theory of Relativity <sup>(tm)</sup><br /></h3>
<p>This is actually one of the simpler theories, but misunderstood by a lot of people&#8230;</p>
<h4>What is so special about it ?<br /></h4>
<p>And would it not be better if we got started with general relativity first ?</p>
<p>Actually special relativity is easier then general relativity; special relativity describes relativity for easy cases, while the general theory tries do describe all possibilities in a single theory&#8230;</p>
<p><img style="float: left;" src="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/image.axd?picture=2010%2f1%2fEinsteinSpeedOfLight.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4>Ok, so what is it all about ?</h4>
<p>In order to explain it, I first looked at some references (i.e. wikipedia), but they seem to talk Jibberish for the most part, so I will try to explain it in my own words, using an example.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Albert Einstein used to approach Physics in a very theoretical way; he made up special cases using the extremes of physics laws, and then imagined what would happen. This theory probably started with the observation that the speed of light was constant. Think about this : no mather where you are, the light always travels at the same -albeit very high- speed. Einstein wondered what it would look like if he would fly in front of a top of a ray of light that was fired&#8230; Would you be able to see the top of the light or not ?</p>
<p><img style="float: right;" src="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/image.axd?picture=2010%2f1%2fSpeedOfLightTop.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4>Why is that such a good question ? It just sounds like a lot of mumbo-jumbo to me &#8230;<br /></h4>
<p>Think about it; as you might know - or not, depending on your age or background - , we can see things because light reflects on it. Everything you see is because a ray of light (from a lamp or the sun) reaches your eyes, either directly, or by reflecting from another surface. You could compare it with this : the light source emits a constant flow of marbles, and these marbles hit your eyes, either directly, our by bouncing on other surfaces&#8230;</p>
<p>Remember that the speed of light was constant ? This would mean that all those marbles travel at the same speed, no mather where they are; either they are moving at the speed of light, or they cease to exist&#8230;.</p>
<p>If we now go back to Einstein sitting at the rocket, flying at the speed of light, and trying to look to the top of the light, would he see it ? I suppose not; lets look at it from above. (Look at the image on the right)</p>
<p>If Einstein travels at the speed of light the light would never hit his eyes, because he moves as fast as the speed of light. (Two things that move at the same speed will never touch each other.) Hey, this looks like an interesting question after all&#8230; But what has this got to do with this special theory of relativity ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Einstein says time and place do not exist seperately<br /></h3>
<p>What do you mean, &#8220;a place does not exist without time&#8221;, are you nuts ? I am at home today, and later on I will be at the shopping mall. Please tell me why a place would not exist ? Oh Man !! And, by the way, I overheard that one can never travel at the speed of light, except maybe through wormholes, so what is that all about ???</p>
<h4>Time and it&#8217;s perception<br /></h4>
<p>Calm down, one step at a time&#8230; To explain it, I will take you back to the marbles example, but this time with another case. First I will try explaining this aspect to you in a simple sentence :</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The exact time you see something happening is dependent on your distance from the event.</em></p>
<p>Take a good look at the sentence above; this means that if you and another person look at something, you have a different perception about the exact time it happened. I can explain this to you with a simple picture.</p>
<p><img style="float: left;" src="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/image.axd?picture=2010%2f1%2fRelativeSpeed.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This picture represents a light bulb that emits yellow light, and suddenly switches to red light. Each row is a timeframe.</p>
<p>In the beginning a light is emitting yellow marbles, so both people see yellow light bulb&#8230; Then, a certain moment the light bulb switches from red to blue. Now, you do remember that light is like marbles who always travel at exact the same speed, do you ? What would this mean ? The moment the light switches to red, the persons would still be receiving the yellow marbles, and not the red ones. So, while the light is actually red, both the left and the right person would still be receiving the yellow version&#8230;</p>
<p>Next to this, you can see that when the first red marble hits the left person (i.e. the left person sees a red bulb), the right person still sees a yellow bulb, as the red ones have not reached him yet&#8230;. This means that the time when something happens at another location depends on the viewer&#8217;s distance from that event; there is a delay.</p>
<p>The reason we never spot this in real life is that the speed of light is very high which makes the delays really small&#8230;</p>
<p>What we actually showed in this part is that time is relative to the observer&#8217;s location, if you see something happening, the exact time you notice it depends on the distance you are away from it, So there is a delay&#8230;.</p>
<p>This also imples that there is no absolute reference to &#8220;time&#8221;; while we all have the impressions that we &#8220;are in the same moment&#8221;, the &#8220;moment of another person&#8221; is slightly delayed from yours, since you are not in in same place&#8230;.</p>
<p>In this case we consider only objects who stay in the same position relative to eachother, but what if one object would be moving away or towards another object; would that have any impact at all&#8230;. Well, I can tell you it does, in the next part I will show you how place/location/dimensions are also relative&#8230;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Whoa ! Place does not exist without time !!! Is this like David Copperfield when he moved the statue of liberty ???</h3>
<p>No, it is not. (Actually Copperfield did not move the statue, he simply gave the whole tent the observers were sitting in a small twist, but that is irrelevant here&#8230;)</p>
<h2>And now we take a break for a short commercial&#8230;</h2>
<p>&#8230; until I am able to finish this blog post. In the mean time please do leave some comments with your opinions, remarks, improvements and suggestions as I want to make these series as good as possible&#8230; I hope you enjoyed the first part and that I will see you back again later !!!</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In December 2008 I was doing my job as a freelance technical analyst for <a href="http://www.gdfsuez.com/en/activities/our-businesses/energy-procurement-and-trading/energy-procurement-and-trading/" target="_blank">a big company</a>. While it was a very interesting job in several ways, I felt that a burn-out was coming up. I had no idea whether this was due to the job, or due to my personal merits ( a newborn and a one-year old son, lots of tasks and chores on my to-do list for our house, a busy social life, &#8230;) Instead of waiting for the man with the hammer, I decided to be proactive about it, so I decided to quit the job and reinvent myself during 2009.</p>
<p>It has been both an interesting, very challenging and enriching year for me, with both high peaks and low valleys.<br /><br />I decided to write this blog post in order to evaluate myself, and I am hoping that other people might find some inspiration in this as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The initial plan</h3>
<p><br />I started the year with both a big and an average sized project which should at least have given me funds enough to get through my first year without any financial concessions. <br />Since the big project was a web application, I started to <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/?tag=/w00t">build my own reference architecture</a> based on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET_MVC_Framework" target="_blank">asp.net mvc</a> app. This has been a very enriching experience for me as I evaluated a lot of technologies and defined my current technology stack.</p>
<p>I will get into this in another part of this post.</p>
<h3>What happened</h3>
<p><br />Both of the projects were fixed price projects for the same company. As I had done a very special consultancy job for one of the division leaders for that company, I had a very solid professional relationship based on trust and integrity with that person. Since I was going to implement the average sized project for him, and they were looking for extra resources, he asked me if I was interested in doing a project for another division as well. <br />This is the part where I took the wrong decision:<br />For the average sized project, we did not have a contract at all. I know this might sound stupid, but this was simply because we both knew we could trust each other&#8230;<br />Based on my previous experiences with this company and a tight deadline, I decided to put up a preliminary contract for the big project, thinking we would be able to agree on the titbits later. However, the project&#8217;s scope grew by the second, and after working day and night, reimplementing stuff over and over again, and only billing a fraction of the time I invested, we got to the point where we could not get to an agreement any more&#8230;<br />Luckily the trusted division leader was able to guard his own resources, so that I could at least finish his project and get it shipped/billed/paid.<br />In case you are wondering on the outcome of the big project, I will probably get the resulting verdict from my lawyer in February later on this year.</p>
<h3>Lessons learned</h3>
<p><br />Reflecting on this, it is strange that such obvious facts as the following did not appear to me during the project, so that is why I mention them explicit here:<br />- Always have a very detailed quote/contract that states everything in detail. Mention in the contract that every extra/change to the original quote/contract should be agreed upon in a contract appendix, no matter how small. The main reason for the scope creep was probably the fact that I had not been formal enough on their first (small) change requests which grew bigger and bigger each time.<br />- It is not because you can trust a single person in a company on it&#8217;s word, that this is true for the entire company.</p>
<p>- Spread your resources&#8230; You should not be dependent on a single company/person/project&#8230;</p>
<h4>How to avoid making the same mistake again</h4>
<p><br />For every project I now create a rude application prototype, as well as a list of use cases/BDD stories. I do not implement all bdd feature story details, but I do implement those which might point to issues.<br />Using both these tools you have given the prospect an idea on what to expect on both the ui side and the behaviour, as well as an introduction to your approach on the project.<br />The biggest disadvantage of this approach is the amount of time you have to invest in a single quote, but if you do get the project, you can bill (part of) it back, since this is actual analysis.<br />Call me Captain Obvious, but it occurred to me that, in order to get a correct quote, you need to do your analysis upfront.<br />I posted a concrete example <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/How-to-do-a-correct-estimate-for-a-project-using-BDD-and-a-HTML-prototypewireframe-built-with-jQuery-PolyPage.aspx">in this blog post.</a><br />Next to this I am careful with bigger projects, since they automatically imply a big risk when something goes wrong&#8230;</p>
<h4>Was it a completely negative experience ?</h4>
<p><br />Luckily for me it was not. At a certain moment I needed to get some office supplies. When I entered the shop, the shop owner (with whom I had done a few small projects in the past) told me that he might have some opportunities for me&#8230; Talk about a coincidence ! I started on some legacy code maintenance, and now I am slowly integrating more and more into his projects&#8230; So far so good. Also, while one part is ASP.Net MVC, another part is Windows Mobile, so this is now another experience I can add to my resume&#8230;<br />This brings me to my next part :</p>
<h3>Broaden my horizons on the development/technology side</h3>
<p><br />By building an Asp.net MVC framework, I did not only broaden my horizon on the .Net side, but also on a lot of alternative technologies. If you are planning on doing any serious development I would suggest you to at least study the following tools/technologies :</p>
<h4>Tools/Technologies</h4>
<p>- An ORM : building your own ORM component in today&#8217;s world is rather ridiculous in my humble opinion; there should be enough alternatives available right now. My final choice was <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org/" target="_blank">Fluent NHibernate</a> which allows me to define my classes based on a few conventions, and automatically wires the database for me.<br />- Dependency injection: While I had already used it quite some time,this year I fully grasped the advantages behind it. This helped my design skills a lot on the &#8216;separation of concerns&#8217; and the testability part&#8230; I now favour composition over inheritance almost every time.<br />- Proper POCO domain objects: I violated my POCO objects&#8217; principles a few times in the past, but I now finally got to the point where they no longer contain anything other then the bare necessities.<br />- Using view models for building my pages: this made my code a lot more maintainable. I also implemented a command pattern for ASP.Net mvc; from that moment <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/The-Quest-for-the-perfect-ASPNet-MVC-code-v03.aspx" target="_blank">all my links were wired in the controllers action</a> (i.e. Viewmodel.AL_SubmitEdit = c=&gt;c.AL(&#8220;Save changes&#8221;,c=&gt;c.Save(null,null)) in the controller view set-up). This implies more extensive testability and removes all implicit references from the controller to the view; the view rendering is only dependent on the view model.<br />- Using <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/archive/2009/01/22/automapper-the-object-object-mapper.aspx" target="_blank">automapper </a>to convert between domain objects and view models: this cleaned up my code a lot, since now all the mapping is defined in a single location.<br />- <a href="http://sparkviewengine.com/" target="_blank">Spark view engine</a>: combining the use of view models with the spark view engine converted my aspx views from ugly ducklings into proper swans&#8230;<br />- Other technology stack items : generic <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html" target="_blank">IRepository pattern</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery </a>+ <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/" target="_blank">plugins</a>, <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/" target="_blank">Log4Net</a>,<a href="http://www.postsharp.org/" target="_blank">PostSharp</a>,&#8230;</p>
<h4>Writing quotes using UI prototypes and BDD<br /></h4>
<p>Next to this I wanted to avoid mismatching future quotes for my clients, and after studying my options for a while i decided to go for <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/demos/prototype/index.html" target="_blank">UI prototypes</a> together with <a href="http://github.com/ToJans/Aubergine/blob/master/Be.Corebvba.Aubergine.Examples/Accounts/Stories/Transfer_money_between_accounts.txt" target="_blank">BDD stories</a>. The problem was I had never done anything BDD related at all. So I started studying/testing/implementing the whole lot.<br />I initially used <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/aaron.jensen/archive/2008/05/08/introducing-machine-specifications-or-mspec-for-short.aspx" target="_blank">Machine.Specifications</a> as a bdd engine, but after using it for a few days I started implementing <a href="http://wiki.github.com/ToJans/Aubergine" target="_blank">my own BDD engine</a>, in order to learn more about BDD and to be able to implement the stories I want to implement within my own constraints. This has been a very valuable experience for me, I learned a lot on BDD and it got me started in OSS.</p>
<h4>Get into open source/github<br /></h4>
<p>I like to learn from the web; by simply browsing and downloading stuff you can teach yourself a lot. As I had published <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/MemberArticles.aspx?amid=616289" target="_blank">a few articles on codeproject</a> as well as on my blog in the past, I decided to share my experiences with the rest of the world by <a href="http://github.com/ToJans" target="_blank">going open source</a> with my BDD engine and so I got started on github.</p>
<p>I never used github before, but in 2009 I had been<a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/To-git-or-not-to-git-Source-control-done-right-intro-and-quick-tutorial.aspx"> studying git </a>as well, and started using it with almost direct result as it made me do a lot more branching/checking in/checking out/experimenting in general without messing up anything at all. You could state that you could do this with any source control repository, but Git made it so easy and instantaneous that I used it a lot more.</p>
<h3>Me vs &#8220;the world&#8221;<sup>(tm)</sup><br /></h3>
<h4>Virtual coworkers / twitter</h4>
<p>Next to this I discovered <a href="http://twitter.com/tojans" target="_blank">twitter</a>. You could ask yourself why this is important from a technology point of view. Well, this is why: working from my home, I do not have any direct contact with fellow devs/architects/&#8230; Twitter allows me to get in touch and ask opinions on a certain matter; once you get a few followers, it gives you the ability to use it as a sort of &#8220;online instant FAQ/opinions database&#8221;. If you have a certain question or just simply want to show of, you can post it to twitter, and based on your followers you will probably get some feedback as well as constructive criticism. Being part of this &#8220;huge brain&#8221; is also fun, since you can see ideas evolve quite a lot some times by giving your own input&#8230;</p>
<h4>Public visibility<br /></h4>
<p>I have also been posting some articles <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/MemberArticles.aspx?amid=616289" target="_blank">on codeproject</a> and <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/?tag=/c">my blog</a> in order to get some opinions on a variety of subjects, some being more successful then others..</p>
<p><a style="float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;display:block" title="this is my #pomodoro timer ;)" href="http://tweetphoto.com/5649602"> <img src="http://cdn.cloudfiles.mosso.com/c54112/x2_5634c2" alt="this is my #pomodoro timer ;)" width="79" height="79" /></a></p>
<h4>Productivity<br /></h4>
<p>And finally, the last I want to mention is the use of a <a href="http://www.gembapantarei.com/2009/06/agile_kanban_journal_day_8_do_we_need_a_done_colum.html" target="_blank">personal kanban </a>together with the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank">pomodoro</a>. I tested it, and it worked great for a few days, but then I started lamenting&#8230;<br />In this year I will be using the kanban technique all the time, and probably the pomodoro as well.. This should give me the ability to properly focus on getting things out of the door on time&#8230;</p>
<p><a title="this is my #pomodoro timer ;)" href="http://tweetphoto.com/5649602"> </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>In conclusion</h3>
<p><br />While 2009 has been a very different year for me, I personally feel I learned a lot in this year; both direct and indirect. It enriched me both as a (business) person and as a developer on several aspects. If you feel a burn-out coming up, and you can somehow manage, try to take a year to do some things you feel the need for. Also note that most of the reasons for not doing this are not such a big issue after you name them, and look at the worst thing that could happen when it does come true&#8230;<br /><br />Best wishes for 2010 !!!<br /><br />Tom</p><div style="text-align:right"><a class="addthis_button" href="http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&amp;pub=xa-4aec37702e3161d4"><img src="http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-share-en.gif" width="125" height="16" alt="Bookmark and Share" style="border:0"/></a><script type="text/javascript" src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pub=xa-4aec37702e3161d4"></script></div>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h3>Introduction : &#8220;Oh my God&#8221;</h3>
<p>The Belgian government managed to do it again; starting from February we have to pay taxes on portable storage, because we MIGHT copy some music on it.</p>
<p>This is utter failure in the biggest possible way; I can accept that our<a title="Minister Q" href="http://www.quickonomie.be/nl/" target="_parent"> dear Minister Q.</a> has had some really strange track records, but this is really his &#8216;best&#8217; realisation ever !!!</p>
<p>As you might or might not know, similar to other countries, we already have to pay a certain amount of taxes for blank DVD&#8217;s/CD&#8217;s. In my personal opinion this was really ridiculous, but since I use about 1 CD/DVD per month, I never really bothered&#8230;</p>
<p>I assume that people probably stopped buying DVD&#8217;s/CD&#8217;s, and as a compensation our government needed to find an alternative. And now they found it !!</p>
<p>Here is an English (google translated) excerpt from an <a href="http://tweakers.net/nieuws/64607/belgische-overheid-verbreedt-kopieerheffing-naar-meer-media.html" target="_blank">article on tweakers.net about it</a> :</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span onmouseover="_tipon(this)" onmouseout="_tipoff()">Thus, as from February 1 for an i<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pod Touch with 64GB</span> of flash storage paid <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3 euros extra</span>.</span> <span onmouseover="_tipon(this)" onmouseout="_tipoff()">A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">set-top box with a 500GB hard drive</span> is responsible for<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 10.75 euros</span>, while an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">external hard drive 1TB or larger to yield 9</span> Euro.</span>&nbsp;<span onmouseover="_tipon(this)" onmouseout="_tipoff()"><br /> Also, a distinction is made between different types of storage devices with the same: an M<span style="text-decoration: underline;">P3 player with 16GB flash</span> memory has a Auvibel fee of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3 Euro</span>, while a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">USB stick with an identical capacity to 1.35 Euro</span> copying levy to be paid.</span></p>
<h3><br /></h3>
<h3>Why is it ridiculous ?<br /></h3>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p>- Starting from tomorrow everybody who has a car will have to pay 10 Euro/month &#8216;speed driving tax&#8217;<br />- What ? Why would I need to pay that ?<br />- Well, we figured out that some people MIGHT be driving to fast in their car, and since it is impossible for us to catch every single driver, we simply tax everyone a little bit for it.<br />- What ? But why ? My grandfather never speeds (He probably drives a bit to slow, but that is a whole different story)&#8230; Why would he have to pay such a tax ?<br />- Well, uhm&#8230; the cost of speeding is to high for society, so everyone has to pay for that&#8230;<br />- I assume, since we pay for it, that we are allowed to drive to fast now ? <br />- No, you can not. It is illegal. If we catch you speeding you have to pay a fine&#8230;<br />- So we now both pay our fine as well as your tax ? <br />- &#8230;</p>
<p>I would also suggest adding a &#8216;murder tax&#8217; to all hammers/wrenches/saws/knifes and other tools, as these might be used to kill someone&#8230;</p>
<p>Wow, the possibilities are endless..</p>
<h3><br /></h3>
<h3>Some even more creative suggestions for our government</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Opportunities multiply as they are seized&#8221; ( Sun Tzu - The art of war )</em></p>
<p>Since we are in a creative mood, I have a few ideas for maximizing future tax incomes for our government to fix their current deficit:</p>
<h4>Linking up several taxes</h4>
<p>If we get a little bit creative, one tax might automatically extend the group of targeted persons. An example</p>
<p>- &#8216;driving without a driver&#8217;s license tax&#8217; : if you do not have a driver&#8217;s license, you might be driving without one&#8230; so we can tax everyone starting from age 12 and up  who has not got a driver&#8217;s license. (If you can somehow reach the pedals while holding the steering wheel you might be driving a car on the public road.) <br />- &#8216;drunk driving taxes&#8217;,&#8217;unpaid parking ticket taxes&#8217;,&#8217;&#8230;&#8217;: since we have a &#8216;driving without a driver&#8217;s license tax&#8217;, we can now tax everyone from age 12 and up for all the possible driver&#8217;s taxes. It does not mather whether they do or do not have a car/driving license, we can tax them&#8230;</p>
<h4>Making up for taxes due to tax evasion</h4>
<p>Since we need to pay a lot of taxes (the rate of cost versus nett wage for an average employee is huge in Belgium), some people try to be creative with their tax forms. So this is my next tax opportunity:</p>
<p>- &#8216;tax evasion tax&#8217; : As we think some MIGHT be cheating on their tax forms, I suggest we invent this new tax to make up for it&#8230;</p>
<h3><br /></h3>
<h3>By the way, what do you suggest to fix the deficit ?</h3>
<p>My idea is really simple, fix government overhead issues. I am not the first one who thinks this solution is a viable one&#8230;</p>
<p>A report of the European Central bank stated that <a href="http://trends.rnews.be/articles/index.jsp?articleID=39808&amp;sectionID=1107&amp;siteID=4#topPage" target="_blank">our government could save about 34 percent just by being more efficient on their job</a>.</p>
<p>In our Belgian government, we have about 800.000 government officials who earn about 10 percent more then their private colleagues, and 70% of the government&#8217;s spendings goes to the wages of the officials (<a href="http://trends.rnews.be/nl/economie/beleid/4-1408-44571/belgische-ambtenaren-zijn-talrijk--duur-en-oud.html#topPage" target="_blank">link</a>). Next to this we have a little over 10.7 million civilians.</p>
<p>You can do the maths if you want to&#8230;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>If it is that simple, why hasn&#8217;t it been fixed yet ?</h3>
<p>Think about it: if a company grows to be an inefficient monster Mister Market simply punishes them. They either need to become more efficient or go broke. There is no alternative. For our government this is not the case.</p>
<p>The debt of our country is about <a href="http://www.nu.nl/economie/1938199/staatsschuld-belgie-stijgt-met-800-euro-per-seconde.html" target="_blank">330.7 billion Euro; it was augmenting 800 euros/second in 2009</a>. This means an average debt of 30.900 Euro per civilian&#8230; In a company, I assume this would mean bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Next to this, one will probable never find sponsors for this &#8217;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augeas" target="_blank">cleaning of the Augean stables</a>&#8217;, since the sponsor of this project could probably be a target himself&#8230;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>In conclusion</h3>
<p>While this was initially just a manifest about the new taxes on portable media I got a little carried away, and ended up somewhere completely different&#8230; Both subjects should not be related, but somehow I managed to mention both in a single post. As a conclusion I would simply like to state the following to our government:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get rid of this &#8216;portable media tax&#8217;. It is ridiculous !!</li>
<li>Instead of spending your time inventing ways to cripple the economy, start thinking about stimuli instead</li>
</ul>
<p>Just my 0.02 Euro</p>
<p>(TODO : send an invoice to the belgian government because I might do some work for them in the future)</p>
<p>PS: I think I will take a backup of this article on both my NAS and an USB stick just to make sure. Can I receive some royalties from Auvibel as well please ?</p>

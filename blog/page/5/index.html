	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h3>We zitten in de problemen in ons landje; hoe zou U als ondernemer het probleem aanpakken ? #BeterBelgie</h3>
<p>Het geld is op, de mensen komen op straat, er is schrik voor de economische malaise en verdere implicaties er van, &#8230;</p>
<p>Als ondernemer zit U dagelijks in gelijkaardige situaties: uw acties hebben niet alleen impact op producten en bedrijven, maar ook op mensen in een directe of indirecte manier. Bijgevolg heeft het merendeel van U een soort van zesde zintuig ontwikkeld om dergelijke problemen op te lossen.</p>
<p>Daarom wil ik aan U als ondernemers vragen: welke suggestie heeft u voor de overheid ? Hoe kunnen we de problemen in dit land op een pragmatische en effici&euml;nte manier gaan oplossen? Ik vraag dus geen gepalaver vanuit de ivoren toren, maar concrete en uitvoerbare oplossingen die het verschil maken.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Waarom zou uw mening beter zijn dan die van de experts ? #BeterBelgie</h3>
<p>Ik ben me er terdege van bewust dat er momenteel redelijk wat knappe koppen zich over deze problemen aan het buigen zijn, met een enorme expertise in hun vakgebied. Jammer genoeg betekent expertise soms ook dat je vastgeroest zit in een bepaald denkpatroon, waardoor je soms de minder voor de hand liggende oplossingen niet ziet. Daarom vraag ik aan U als ondernemer specifiek om ook uw mening te delen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Hoe zorgt U dat uw suggesties gelezen worden? #BeterBelgie</h3>
<p>In deze dagen hebben we 1 groot voordeel: het quasi oneindige bereik en de quasi ongelimiteerde snelheid van het internet. Daarom stel ik voor dat we via Twitter de volgende hashtag lanceren:</p>
<pre>#BeterBelgie</pre>
<p>U kan dan uw mening verspreiden via Twitter, met de hashtag #BeterBelgie . Indien U een idee van een ander een goed idee vindt, dan retweet U zijn/haar tweet; hierdoor komen de beste suggesties automatisch naar boven drijven. Eenvoudiger kan het haast niet!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Hier is alvast een idee: baseer de indexverhogingen op het minimumloon voor een persoon in plaats van het volledige loon #BeterBelgie</h3>
<p>Momenteel wordt de index berekend en toegepast op het volledige loon; ik vind dit redelijk belachelijk omdat de index handelt over het aankopen van basisprodukten.</p>
<p>Hier is mijn voorstel: bereken de index niet meer op basis van het loon van die persoon, maar op basis van het minimumloon voor een persoon in een gelijkaardige situatie. Gezien de index niet zou moeten gaan over het onderhouden van de koopkracht, maar over het voorzien in de basisbehoeften, lijkt mij dit een zeer aanvaardbare oplossing.</p>
<p>Dit heeft 2 voordelen:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Iedereen gelijk voor de wet: als de index naar omhoog gaat, gaat het hier effectief om de koopkracht voor de basisprodukten, lagere bedragen = minder lasten voor de werkgever, de zwakste sociale klassen blijven hetzelfde voordeel houden, en de hogere klassen halen hier geen extra voordeel uit.</li>
<li>Dit geeft de ruimte aan de werknemers om effectief een onderscheid te maken tussen opslag en indexering. Als de index voor de lonen niet meer pro rata het loon gebeurt, dan is er automatisch meer ruimte om de werknemers te belonen die het in de ogen van de werkgever verdienen.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tot slot #BeterBelgie</h3>
<p>Een post zoals deze publiceren kost U maar een paar minuten, maar ik ben er van overtuigd dat we samen tot enkele heel concrete en effici&euml;nte oplossingen voor onze problemen kunnen komen. Uw bijdrage kan het verschil maken, dus post zo snel mogelijk uw mening en verspreid ze via Twitter of elk ander sociaal medium dat U voor handen is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indien uw post het verschil maakt, dan is de Belgische bevolking u direct of indirect eeuwige dankbaarheid verschuldigd !</p>

		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>It was hard keeping this a secret, but I finally can tell you now: I managed to build my very first relatively successful web app.</p>
<p>I built it using <a href="http://nancyfx.org/" target="_blank">NancyFX</a>, <a href="https://github.com/markrendle/Simple.Data" target="_blank">Simple.Data</a> and <a href="http://scritchyexample.apphb.com/" target="_blank">Scritchy </a>in about a month, and it generated 16K Euro during the first month it was in service. After all these <a href="http://nerdbeers.apphb.com/" target="_blank">non-profit</a> and some other fruitless attempts these microframeworks helped me to push out an idea that has been lingering around in my head for a few months now.</p>
<p>In this post I will explain to you how I evolved a simple idea into a few K of cash within a timeframe of just 2 months&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I am currently in the process of studying F# - a functional programming language -.&nbsp;Since I am a <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Essay-the-duality-of-knowledge.aspx">big fan of meta-cognition</a>, I am trying to find out how the mindset of the functional programming paradigm differs from that of a C# one (i.e. the more conventional, object oriented paradigm).</p>
<p>This essay also tries to point out some existing bridges to the functional paradigm that are currently implemented in the imperative programming language C#.</p>
<h3>What is &#8220;Functional programming&#8221; exactly ?</h3>
<p>I will reference <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>&nbsp;- while it still exists - for the definitions:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px; ">In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm&nbsp;
that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions 
and avoids state and mutable data. 
It emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to the imperative&nbsp;
programming style, which emphasizes changes in state.</pre>
<p>Let us start with the first bit:</p>
<p></p>
<h3>A programming paradigm ? What is that ?</h3>
<p>Again from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>:</p>
<pre>A programming paradigm is a fundamental style of computer programming.&nbsp;
(Compare with a methodology, which is a style of solving specific software&nbsp;engineering problems.) 
Paradigms differ in the concepts and abstractions used to represent the elements of a program 
(such as objects, functions, variables, constraints, etc.) 
and the steps that compose a computation 
(assignment, evaluation, continuations, data flows, etc.).</pre>
<p>I will describe my evolution as a developer by looking at the program paradigms I have used. (An overview of the known paradigms can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_paradigms" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
<h4>The imperative paradigm</h4>
<p>This paradigm describes step by step the procedure that should be followed to solve a problem; you could consider this a long list with instructions: first do this, then do that. These are considered the first 3 language generations. This was the first paradigm I learned writing software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The&nbsp;imperative paradigm -&nbsp;Generation 1 -&nbsp;Machine code</h4>
<p>Back in the days, this meant pulling/plugging wires/switches to develop an app; currently you could compare this to writing your app in a hex editor</p>
<p><img src="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/image.axd?picture=2011%2f12%2fhex.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>As I do not know these hex codes by heart (I used to be able to interpret some of the hex codes during my demo/hacking days way back), I used the code from the next generation to generate this output (Yes, I cheated!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The&nbsp;imperative paradigm -&nbsp;Generation 2 - Assembly language</h4>
<p>The machine hardware is abstracted using mnemonics,f.e. MOV EAX,1; please note that the labels could be considered a part of generation 3. Here is an x86 example:</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1493152.js?file=1.essay.asm"></script>
</p>
<p>On a side note: it has been <a href="http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=8765">about 25 years ago</a> since I wrote my last applications in assembly, so it took me some time to get this started again. I built the COM-file in <a href="http://flatassembler.net/" target="_blank">FASM (an assembly IDE and compiler)</a> and used <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/" target="_blank">dosbox</a> to run it, since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COM_file" target="_blank">a COM-file is considered 16-bit and is unsupported on Windows 7</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The&nbsp;imperative/structured/procedural&nbsp;paradigm -&nbsp;Generation 3 -&nbsp;Procedural language or high-level language</h4>
<p>This is the first generation that allows you to represent your problem in the language of your problem domain introducing the concept of variable names/function names etc.. The structured means it tries to avoid GOTO statements, but replaces them with while/Foreach/&#8230; Here is a Pascal example:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1493152.js?file=2.essay.pas"></script>
</p>
<p>This also took me a while to write it, since it has been even longer since I wrote (Turbo) Pascal; I used<a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/devpascal.html" target="_blank"> Dev Pascal</a> to write and test this code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The&nbsp;imperative/structured&nbsp;object-oriented paradigm</h4>
<p>While the procedural paradigm offers some abstraction regarding your problem domain, it still requires you to describe your problem domain in a series of procedures. OO design is the next step; OO allows you to group procedures and functions and attach them to their respective data. This allows you to group functionality and data by behavior. Please note that showing this example case in OO is a bit ridiculous, as the functionality is quite simple. However, as complexity grows, OO offers some real advantages.</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1493152.js?file=3.essay.cs"></script>
</p>
<p>As this is the language/paradigm I have been working in for the last years, this did not take to much effort&#8230;</p>
<p>OO is currently considered as one of the mainstream ways to approach software development (n=1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The functional paradigm</h4>
<p>Ok, we considered my evolution as a developer (and I assume there are a lot of you who have made a similar progression), so now it is time to take a look again at the rest of the definition:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px; ">In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm&nbsp;
that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions 
and avoids state and mutable data. 
It emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to the imperative&nbsp;
programming style, which emphasizes changes in state.</pre>
<p>Hmmz, what does this mean exactly ? This means that instead of modifying the data, we only have immutable state that we transform through functions. How does this look ? Here is the F# example:</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1493152.js?file=essay.fs"></script>
</p>
<p>Disclaimer: As I am new to F#, I gave it my best shot, and it&nbsp;took me some time to write.</p>
<p>Luckily I got <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/rickasaurus/status/148780837368901633" target="_blank">a confirmation from @Rickasaurus/Richard Meinerich that it is an acceptable implementation</a>.</p>
<h3><br /></h3>
<h3>Hmmz; these look similar; what did I do wrong ?</h3>
<p>In hindsight, I would have to say that I probably have chosen a wrong example as this does not demonstrate the advantages of functional programming. So, while this was a nice exercise and fun to do - x86 asm FTW! - , it does not really help a lot.</p>
<p>However, I did read a nice description somewhere on the internet (I can not exactly recall where), but it said something similar to this:</p>
<pre>Draw a grid, with the column headers being the Types in your problem, 
and the row headers the functionalities. 
When doing OO, you use the columns as building blocks;
when doing functional programs, you use the rows as building blocks</pre>
<p>This sums it up pretty nicely I think, and it somehow helped me to get started with functional programming. The focus is on the behavior, not on the data structures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Here&#8217;s a fact; you are probably using the functional approach already</h3>
<p>Yes ? What ? How ?</p>
<p>Ever heard about SQL SELECT statements? This could be considered an application of functional programming, You have an immutable state (within the scope of a query), and map/reduce it at runtime to a new set of data. Or how about Linq ?</p>
<p>In fact, every time you pass in an Action/Func/Predicate in C#, you are actually doing functional programming&#8230;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One can do imperative programming in a functional language, as wel as functional programming in an imperative language, but the specific language facilitates the paradigm you should use it for. For example, take a look at that F# code again; do you see a single reference to a specific type in this code ? No you do not. Does this mean that this is dynamically typed then ? No, it is not, as the compiler can figure out the types by analyzing the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I wrote this article to enable a paradigm shift, and it worked for me. Functional programming requires a whole new approach to solutions, by representing them in another way. While learning something new, I always consider it a good thing to take a step back, and look at it from a distance. This article was such an attempt, and I hope it was as usefull to you as it was to me.</p><div style="text-align:right"><a class="addthis_button" href="http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&amp;pub=xa-4aec37702e3161d4"><img src="http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-share-en.gif" width="125" height="16" alt="Bookmark and Share" style="border:0"/></a><script type="text/javascript" src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pub=xa-4aec37702e3161d4"></script></div>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The concept behind CQRS is neat: detach your domain implementation completely from your representation requirements. I even wrote a framework for it&nbsp;as a learning tool, so somebody without any prior experience should be able to boot a CQRS app in a few minutes.</p>
<p>The main idea behind this framework is providing developers new to CQRS an operating room where they can compose their own little<a href="http://youtu.be/xos2MnVxe-c" target="_blank"> CQRS Frankenstein app</a>.</p>
<p>The whole framework is constructed in a way that it forces you to make your domain implementation completely persistence ignorant, respecting typical AR/transactional boundaries.</p>
<p><a href="http://github.com/ToJans/Scritchy/wiki" target="_blank">Scritchy</a> is not &#8220;the framework to write CQRS apps&#8221;; Scritchy is a framework that tries to provide you a learning platform where you can start grasping the basic principles, advantages and disadvantages in using CQRS.</p>
<p>Once you understand the basic principles behind the CQRS setup, and why everything is setup the way it is, I would advise anybody to gradually replace parts of the framework and just opt for whatever approach you like, using proper message busses, pub/sub/&#8230;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you write your app following the conventions Scritchy dictates, the only thing you need to change to remove the Scritchy dependency is the base object your Aggregate Root inherits from; that is the only dependency that is ever necessary in you app implementation. This was by design,to make future migrations as easy as possible.</p>
<p>I wrote this framework to enable a dev new to CQRS to get his app up and running in a few minutes&#8230; But apparently that is not enough&#8230;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Once upon a time at a certain newsgroup&#8230;</h3>
<p>There has been <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/dddcqrs/cSgPPgMFEq8" target="_blank">a huge discussion over at the CQRS newsgroup about whether a CQRS framework has a &#8220;raison d&#8217;&ecirc;tre&#8221;</a>. I think it has, as a learning tool, some disagree; I&#8217;m fine with that:</p>
<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/386/" target="_blank"><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png" alt="XKCD: duty calls" /></a></p>
<p>What I find really odd however, is that white coats are now starting to draw <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/dddcqrs/XAq0lCyLDs4" target="_blank">&#8220;MetaSchema&#8217;s&#8221;</a> or whatever the **** they call them, complicating and abstracting a very simple concept even more then necessary.</p>
<p>As an answer to that<a href="https://github.com/ToJans/MinimalisticCQRS/blob/master/MinimalisticCQRS/MiniCQRS.cs" target="_blank"> I wrapped up a basic app in a few hours which demonstrated about what I think CQRS is in it&#8217;s core concept</a>, i.e. make a CQRS app as simple as possible, only abstracting what you absolutely have to&#8230;</p>
<p>This is the answer I got:</p>
<pre><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">It is unfortunate that people learn programming without meeting the basic tenets of structured programming.&nbsp;
</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Programming with procedures (your commands and queries) has been here form more then 30 decades,&nbsp;
</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">some are commands other are queries. CQS is usually applied here too!</span></pre>
<p>ROFL !! Talk about missing the point!! Anyway, after all these fruitless attempts I decided to invest my time in some things more productive and get away from all these semantic meta-level blahblahblah&#8230;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CQRS - the essence IMO - how would you explain it to a 10-year old ?</h3>
<p>All those neat diagrams perfectly aligned and perfectly abstracting away everything in CQRS usually give me the shivers, which is why I started writing this article in the first place. I think<a href="http://codeofrob.com/archive/2011/09/28/cqrs-is-too-complicated.aspx" target="_blank"> Rob Ashton&#8217;s article was a great attempt</a>, but still a bit to complicated.</p>
<p>One of <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/tomjanssens" target="_blank">my current occupations as an ICT generalist is giving strategic ICT advice</a>. Every time we talk about customer interaction/transfering your intent to your customers, I suggest them to interact with their customers as if they were 10-year-olds as an exercise, in order to get to the essence of their intent&#8230; So I decided to dogfood this approach, and here is my attempt to explain CQRS to my 10-year-old audience:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is all there is to CQRS IMO, nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>(For all the font freaks, the typeface used in this graph is MouseDrawn&trade;, which will be available for ordering soon, SRP 10K&euro; ;) ).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>CQRS is a neat concept, and applying it <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/My-CQRS-Cookbook.aspx">gives you all kinds of advantages</a>&#8230; But there is no need to make it more complicated then it is; in essence it is just about separating your domain implementation from your UI representation, nothing more, nothin less.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel a lot of people are getting confused when they try to get started with CQRS. There is no need to; just separate your UI/domain implementation and UI representation.</p>
<p>People interested in the absolute minimum required to do CQRS, I suggest to take a look <a href="https://github.com/ToJans/MinimalisticCQRS/blob/master/MinimalisticCQRS/MiniCQRS.cs" target="_blank">at my example app over at github</a>. I would advise <a href="https://github.com/ToJans/Scritchy" target="_blank">Scritchy to people who want to experiment with CQRS for the first time and want a proper app architecture</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/Scritchy" target="_blank">nuget available</a>). For others - the more experienced people - I suggest you opt for whatever you think is appropriate, as CQRS is not about components, it is about a concept.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h3>Introduction.</h3>
<p>Everybody loves experts, at least I know I do! I love being able to toss almost every single question or problem to one or more experts in order to gain new insights and understandings.</p>
<p>In most cases, your knowledge network really grows exponentially as you age. Knowledge networks should be cherished and nurtured, as they will allow you to accelerate your personal knowledge growth in an exponential rate.</p>
<p>But, there is a catch: can you remember the last time you disagreed with an expert ?</p>
<p>There is an common acronym on the internet: &#8220;KIP&#8221;, which is short for &#8220;Knowledge is power&#8221; - it is also the Dutch word for &#8220;chicken&#8221;, but that is completely irrelevant in this essay - . In most cases, I tend to agree, but in some I do not&#8230; Here is an explanation:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The duality of knowledge, it is all about the dots&#8230;</h3>
<p>Fact: Knowledge is power, but it can also hold you back.</p>
<p>What was the last time you woke up with an answer to a problem you had been trying to solve the day before ? Why are we able to see a (usually straightforward) solution after a good night of sleep ? In my experience problem solving is about connecting the dots. You start with an initial path, and you grow this path until you find a viable solution. You choose these paths based on what you learned in previous similar situations.</p>
<p>That is in fact the essence of our brain, you can consider it a huge amount of dots with a lot of paths between them; some are very wide highways, and some are just very tiny paths, who merely exist. As we take a path more and more, it grows and expands naturally, so we are inclined to take this route even more.</p>
<p>Sometimes you start of with the wrong dots, and are unable to reach your final destination on your problem solving path. Ideas usually evolve quite naturally, like in a genetic algorithm, but the problem is solutions converge slowly or in a wrong direction if you started with the wrong ancestors.</p>
<p>I like to consider a good night of sleep a simple way to change those ancestors, which enables you to get started with a completely new path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Dr. Evil and your guardian angel can alter your path.</h3>
<p>As a person, we are what we experience. In our brains, associations between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron" target="_blank">neurons </a>(the dots) grow stronger as we experience something. This is why experiments like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlov's_dog" target="_blank">Pavlov&#8217;s dog</a> are possible. We are actually conditioned to make associations more and more as we experience them&#8230;</p>
<p>Now, think about cause and consequence. What if we turn this reasoning around ? Can we change the way we think ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>&#8220;Yes we can!&#8221;&nbsp;- Barack Obama</h3>
<p>Yes, we can change the way we think, there is a thing we call<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming" target="_blank"> NLP (Neuro-linguistic programming)</a> which does exactly that. By choice of words one can actually influence your own brain paths, or the path of a person we are talking to. There is a vast amount of literature available on this subject, and I urge you to take a look at it. It will help you to develop a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition" target="_blank">metacognition </a>(i.e. think about what and how you think), which will allow you to grow as a person.</p>
<p>NLP is a powerful technique; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult#Mind_control" target="_blank">cult leaders and hard sellers are employing these all the time</a> to get what they want. But you should not consider this a pure &#8220;Dr. Evil&#8221; approach, as there are multiple usages for a hammer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>All this &#8220;Blah&#8221;, and I still do not have a clue why knowledge has a duality to it ?</h3>
<p>We are conditioned to connect the dots in a certain way. The fact that mankind is able to do (almost) impossible things, is because of this knowledge, the accumulation of experience. Knowledge transfer is making the group bigger than the sum of its individual parts. But sometimes it does not&#8230;</p>
<p>Here is a quote which I love a lot, which covers the essence of this essay:</p>
<pre>  &ldquo;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse.&rdquo; - Henry Ford</pre>
<p>Think about it! A lot of the progress mankind made was due to the fact that those great thinkers questioned the existing knowledge, and were able to connect the dots in a way nobody had ever been able to connect the dots before&#8230;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><br /></h3>
<h3>Knowledge as a restriction&#8230; also known as &#8220;the conventional approach&#8221;.</h3>
<p>In most cases knowledge is a big advantage, in fact, I would even say a huge advantage. However, there are also numerous amounts of opportunities where we choose a wrong or less efficient solution to a problem, simple because we are conditioned to do so.</p>
<p>This is why you can usually see conflicts emerge between a junior and a senior; the senior has acquired a lot of experience in a certain field, so he knows the pitfalls and best ways to provide a solution to a problem, so he tries to teach a junior a conventional way to approach a problem. A junior however, usually need to make these faults on his/her own in order to realize why things are done according to a certain convention.</p>
<p>However, sometimes the junior finds a new path.&nbsp;This is exactly where great new insights are born. All of a sudden a junior connects the dots in a different way, and &#8220;BOOM !!&#8221;, we gain a new insight.</p>
<p>So while convention is good in most of the cases, in order to make progress we actually need to change those conventions.</p>
<p>A few simple examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>most consultants will only suggest the solutions they know or favor</li>
<li>thinking out of the box usually helps you to be really successful in business</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;">A recent example: software architecture.</span></p>
<p>One of the main contexts where you can apply this concept all the time, is in software architecture.</p>
<p>There are usually two opposites in this context:</p>
<ul>
<li>The extreme architect: he wants to have the architecture of the application completely abstracted from the domain (=business logic)</li>
<li>The extreme pragmatic: he just wants to be as efficient as possible, i.e. every single line written should have maximum business value</li>
</ul>
<div>While both have its merits, I think we should be able to find a proper consensus between the two. You should grow a software architecture as you progress your app, and start of with the simplest thing that could possibly work, but in a reasonable way. As your complexity increases, your architecture needs to evolve as well, since you will otherwise blow your maintenance budget due to unmaintainable code.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Finding a proper balance between architecture and pragmatism has proven a really delicate subject, and I assume it will be forever. However, it is my personal belief that both extremes should be avoided (no architecture vs over-architected apps).</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Knowledge is important; cherish it and nurture it. But always keep in mind that the conventional path might not always be the best one. Sometimes an alternative point of view can help you to put things in a new perspective.</p>
<p>(In fact, my consultancy model is based on the exact opposite, so if you need a new point of view for your business, just contact me.)</p>
<p>Finally, here is another one of my favorite quotes:</p>
<pre>"I can't understand why people are frightened of new ideas.&nbsp;
I'm frightened of the old ones." - John Cage</pre>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp;</span></p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Most people who get started with CQRS have issues with this classical example: &#8220;how do we verify username uniqueness when a new user registers ?&#8221;.</p>
<p>While user authentication is something that has been implemented numerous amounts of times before, and one should usually not reinvent the wheel but use an existing software library for this particular case, the problem in itself is rather interesting, and happens quite a lot in a domain.</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1366502.js?file=00%20Old%20specs.txt"></script>
</p>
<p>In this small article I will show you a simple proper way to resolve the issue respecting CQRS/DDD principles.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><br /></h3>
<h3>Is that really what we want ?</h3>
<p>Let us think about another way to solve the issue. I will rewrite the scenario a little bit:</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1366502.js?file=01%20New%20specs.txt%20"></script>
</p>
<h3><br /></h3>
<h3>Great, now we have a pending registration ! How is that helpful ?</h3>
<p>Not so quick! I have a rule of thumb: whenever I have to communicate between different AR&#8217;s (even the ones of the same AR type), I use a saga. What is uniqueness validation when you think about it ? Exactly !! A question to all the other AR&#8217;s whether an entity with the same properties exists. So let us have a second scenario for the saga:</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1366502.js?file=03%20The%20saga%20specs"></script>
</p>
<p>Please note that scenario&#8217;s for sagas are a little different:</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1366502.js?file=04%20Saga%20specs%20template"></script>
</p>
<h3><br /></h3>
<h3>Example code</h3>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1366502.js?file=05%20Example%20saga.cs"></script>
</p>
<h3><br /></h3>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>There you have it, a simple and elegant solution to a problem everybody struggles with in the beginning.</p><div style="text-align:right"><a class="addthis_button" href="http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&amp;pub=xa-4aec37702e3161d4"><img src="http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-share-en.gif" width="125" height="16" alt="Bookmark and Share" style="border:0"/></a><script type="text/javascript" src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pub=xa-4aec37702e3161d4"></script></div>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This article will show you how you can do TDD/BDD with Visual Studio Express editions. While most people say it is not possible, it is actually pretty easy.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express" target="_blank">A Visual Studio Express edition</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/continuoustests/AutoTest.Net/downloads" target="_blank">AutoTest.Net</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nuget.codeplex.com/releases" target="_blank">Nuget</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>How do you do it ?</h3>
<p></p>
<div><ol>
<li>Open your project in Visual Studio Express</li>
<li>Add a new class project, name it [Project].Specs</li>
<li>Add a reference to the testlib you want to use with Nuget (Right click on the project references and choose &#8220;Manage Nuget Packages&#8221;) - I use MSpec a lot.</li>
<li>Start AutoTest.Net, after you configured it for the testlib (adjust AutoTest.config file for the correct testrunner)</li>
<li>Start writing your specs</li>
<li>Every time you save a file, your project is compiled and your tests are ran</li>
</ol>
<div>That is all you need; pretty simple actually, is it not ?</div>
</div>
<div>There is also the possibility to have notifications and stuff like that, but I currently do not use them.</div>
<h3>But wait, what if I need to debug a test ?</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: normal;">As I sometimes only do integration tests, I need the ability to debug these tests. But there is no option to do this in the Express editions, or is there ?</span></p>
<div>Well, this took me a bit longer to find out, but once you know how to do this it is pretty easy:</div>
<ol>
<li>Right click on your spec project, and choose &#8220;Unload project&#8221;</li>
<li>Right click the unloaded project and choose &#8220;edit [xxx].Specs.csproj&#8221;, you will see an XML</li>
<li>Find the matching PropertyGroup for your configuration (usually&nbsp;&lt;PropertyGroup Condition=&#8221; &#8216;$(Configuration)|$(Platform)&#8217; == &#8216;Debug|AnyCPU&#8217; &#8220;&gt; )?</li>
<li>Add the following child items in the property group (I used mspec as an example here):<br />
<pre>&lt;PropertyGroup Condition=" '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Debug|AnyCPU' "&gt;
      ....
      &lt;StartAction&gt;Program&lt;/StartAction&gt;
      &lt;StartProgram&gt;C:\Users\Public\Documents\OudePc\Projecten\Org.NerdBeers\src\Org.NerdBeers\packages\Machine.Specifications.0.4.24.0\tools\mspec-x86-clr4.exe&lt;/StartProgram&gt;
      &lt;StartArguments&gt;Org.Nerdbeers.specs.dll&lt;/StartArguments&gt;
      &lt;StartWorkingDirectory&gt;C:\Users\Public\Documents\OudePc\Projecten\Org.NerdBeers\src\Org.NerdBeers\Org.NerdBeers.Specs\bin\Debug&lt;/StartWorkingDirectory&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;</pre>
</li>
<li>Save and close the .csproj file</li>
<li>Right click on the project and reload it</li>
<li>Set a breakpoint in the test you want to debug</li>
<li>Right click again on the project, and&#8230;.. </li>
<li>&#8230; you can now choose &#8220;Debug this project&#8221; &nbsp;!!!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Final words</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: normal;">While this approach takes a few minutes to setup, it is definetely not that hard to do. In fact, I just copy the test exes and settings over from another project whenever I need to do it a second time on the same machine. At least this approach will allow you to do proper TDD/BDD with the Express editions of Visual Studio.</span></p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html">CQRS</a> is one of my architectural pet peeves, as you might have noticed<a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/?tag=/CQRS"> from the numerous amount of blog posts I made on this subject</a>. However, I noticed the concept is complicated and hard to grasp for newcomers to CQRS. I have been spiking numerous attempts of a framework that makes CQRS both more manageable and understandable, failed hundreds of times, and even published a few of my acceptable attempts as gists <a href="https://github.com/tojans">over at github</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>A few days ago I was messing around with <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AsynchronousScalableWebApplicationsWithRealtimePersistentLongrunningConnectionsWithSignalR.aspx" target="_blank">SignalR</a> trying to setup again another CQRS attempt, and failed miserably&#8230;. However, 2 nights after that approach I had an ephiphany which had been lingering around in my head ever since.</p>
<p>Today I decided to get back to business, so this afternoon I started spiking a proof of concept (POC).</p>
<p>I think you will be happy to see that I managed to get most of the annoyance out of CQRS with this simple concept.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Show me the codez !!!</h3>
<p>Before I show you the codes, I would like to mention a few things, since it is a POC:</p>
<ul>
<li>My eventstore is currently implemented as a List of objects. While this works for this concept, you can imagine that this might get you into trouble</li>
<li>The Aggregate roots get completely rebuilt every single time (no cache), so the app might get a litlle bit slow when you push numerous commands to it</li>
<li>The concept is completely synchronous, but making it asynchronous should be effortless.</li>
<li>The functionality I talked about in these 3 points are currently implemented as overrides of the abstract class ScratchBus, which requires you to override the function to load an ar, and to replay events on an object. As there are some nice alternatives available, I am not planning on reimplementing them, but for now I opt for <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Continuous-thinking-just-ship-it-the-story-of-NerdBeers.aspx">the simplest thing that could possibly work</a>.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I am currently still thinking about conventions for the viewmodels as these conventions need to provide more flexibiltity then just EVENT/AR.ID binding&#8230; I am not sure whether I will find an acceptable solution on that matter&#8230;</span>&nbsp;<strong>Update:</strong> KISS as usual, view instances are built/modified by stateless handlers; piece of cake !</li>
</ul>
<div>Anyway, enough stalling, here we go:</div>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1304066.js"></script>
</p>
<p>This is the only code required to get a fully working AR with events&#8230; IMO it looks pretty clean. As you might have guessed there are some conventions used in order to get the plumbing out of the way.</p>
<p>What do you think ? Pretty clean I would assume ?</p>
<h3>Sold! Where can I get it ?</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Depending on the feedback I get, I might push it online <a href="https://github.com/tojans" target="_blank">over at my github account</a>, but for now, I would rather try to find a good solution for the viewmodel/event conventions</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I published the sourcecode <a href="https://github.com/ToJans/Scritchy" target="_blank">over at my github account</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Whenever I push the source to github, the <a href="http://scritchyexample.apphb.com/" target="_blank">demo at appharbor</a> gets updated as well automagically.</p>
<p>Feel free to PM me any time (or tweet; <a href="http://twitter.com/#/tojans" target="_blank">@tojans</a> )&#8230;</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>While this is still a work in progress, and nowhere near ready for production usage, I think this might actually be a pretty cool implementation. If I can somehow find a way to complete this framework, I think I might be on to something here.</p>
<p>I am aware that CQRS is considered to complicated by some, and I am aware that some experts advise against the usage of CQRS in most cases.&nbsp;However, it is my opinion that CQRS provides you with a proper template for development, where everything is nicely separated the way it is supposed to be, and easily adjustable. Another motivation for the CQRS approach is the spaghetti-code of the nillies, currently also known as lasagna-code: numerous amounts of layers over layers that make adding a simple field to a screen a few days of work.</p>
<p>By providing Scritchy, I am trying to find a way to make CQRS not only working, but also relatively easy to use and understand.</p>
<p>This is not the end, but the beginning of a new path&#8230;</p><div style="text-align:right"><a class="addthis_button" href="http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&amp;pub=xa-4aec37702e3161d4"><img src="http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-share-en.gif" width="125" height="16" alt="Bookmark and Share" style="border:0"/></a><script type="text/javascript" src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pub=xa-4aec37702e3161d4"></script></div>

		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I just finished commenting someone&#8217;s opinion on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator" target="_blank">the MBTI personality type</a>&nbsp;in a linkedin status update.</p>
<p>As you might have read in <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Continuous-thinking-Essay-The-secret-sauce-of-great-leadership-IMO-B)-.aspx">my previous post regarding &#8220;The secret sauce of great leadership - IMO ;)&#8221;</a> I am an avid fan of determining your own personality type in order to improve yourself.</p>
<p>Because this person had seen <a href="http://vimeo.com/20441760" target="_blank">a presentation by Patrick Vermeren on the myth of MBTI</a>, he <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/berkun/status/121332727134949376" target="_blank">retweeted the following</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; "><em><strong>I wish there was a test to take to find out how much you hate Meyers-Briggs (MBTI). I&#8217;d score off the charts.</strong></em></p>
<p>Since I most certainly do not agree, I commented some things on the linkedin thread. As I think the comment might have some value for my blog readers as well, I decided to post it here as well:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Here is my opinion</h3>
<p>I believe your personality can change during puberty, but afterwards it is pretty much fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MBTI made me aware of my personality, and how to bridge to other types of personalities, by making the differences explicit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the test might not be spot on for some (f.e. my sister), it was spot on for me; the description matched me in both positive and negative ways. Since then I have learned to accept my personality, and being aware of your shortcomings and strengths helps you to improve yourself (i.e. self-awareness is key here). Once you master handling yourself, you can attempt to guess your discussion partner&#8217;s MBTI type, which is quite obvious for the first letters,&nbsp;&nbsp;but harder for the next:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Introvert or Extravert ? (easy)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Sensing or iNtuitive (i.e. perception by facts or intuition)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Feeling or Thinking (i.e. emotion vs ratio)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Judging or Percepting (i.e. judge and get done with it vs constantly looking for alternative options/possibilities)&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you realize the type of your conversation partner, you should know how to talk to him/her&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>While the MBTI test is certainly not a solution to everything, it can increase your self-awareness, and in the next phase also the awareness on how to interact with your discussion partner. You could compare this to level 3 and level 4 thinking in poker.</p>
<p>In my opinion anything that builds your self-awareness can be a good tool to expand your personal horizon.</p>

		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>What <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator" target="_blank">MBTI personality type</a> are are you ? If you do not know, I would suggest you find it out (I did it <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp" target="_blank">here</a>, it only takes a few minutes).</p>
<p>I did it, and it was an epiphany. Apparently, I am an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENTP" target="_blank">ENTP</a>. For years, I felt like I did not know anybody who had a personality similar to mine. Now I do, and I found some great online discussion groups all populated with aligned personalities.</p>
<p>In one of those threads, we had a great discussion on how your personality influences your professional life.</p>
<p>Enough off-topic blahblahblah&trade;, time to get to the subject. In the mentioned discussion thread, I gave away my &#8220;secret sauce of great leadership - IMO ;) -&#8220;, just like that, for free&#8230; As I received some great comments, I was thinking: &#8220;Maybe posting this to my blog might be helpfull for some readers as well&#8221;. So I did.</p>
<p>Unlike most of the stuff the Oracles out there are spreading, it is not some kind of a magic formula, on the contrary: it is hard work. It is also small and coincise; there is no need to overcomplicate things.. This is my personal approach. I use it all the time, and it works for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So without further ado, here we go; this is my personal &#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>&#8220;Secret sauce of great leadership - IMO ;) -&#8221;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once upon a time on a forum&#8230;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Usually when I start a new assignment, I gather my info by asking just about everybody for info or opinions, even the ones who are usually ignored. I tend to keep my own opinions to myself in the beginning.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I also prefer informal/personal contact over any other form&#8230; If possible I prefer a function name &#8220;from the lower trenches&#8221; so people consider me part of &#8220;us&#8221; in &#8220;us vs them&#8221;.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The whole idea is finding out who will be able to do what in a group, and maybe find out who is not in the correct place, who would be the key players, &#8230;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Next to this you also have to gain some respect by fixing some things which nobody has been able to fix up until then.. The ideal situation is that people come to you when they seem to be stuck&#8230;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Once you have gained some respect and figured out some of the group dynamics, you can start throwing out some hints (think like in chess/multiple steps ahead), and try to get the key persons involved&#8230;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Once you gain momentum, and get the machine up and running, you can keep it running with a little or no extra effort&#8230; You just need to make sure everybody stays aligned and motivated within the boundaries.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A well-oiled team will grow over time in both confidence &amp; strength. As they grow, you get a positive vibe, which allows you to take the group to a new high.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>After a while there will usually emerge some natural leaders, and your job is finished !&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>IMO Good leadership is low-profile, almost unnoticeable&#8230; It is not so much about telling people what to do, but helping everyone to find a position where they can grow and love what they are doing&#8230; (At least that is the way I learned it from my mentors.)&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>IMO there is nothing more to it&#8230; This is all you need! Some of it might come natural to you, some things might be hard. This might not work for you, but I would assume it would in most cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>There you have it. I gave away my &#8220;secret&#8221;. No strings attached, no fees asked (and no guarantees either <img title="Laughing" src="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/editors/tiny_mce3/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-laughing.gif" border="0" alt="Laughing" />). All I can say is this approach works for me. I am not a guru, but I think this works if you put your mind to it. Just try it!</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name">How Your Personality Type Affects Your Development</h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>During one of my more recent interviews I got an assesment from two different persons. While I still have no idea about the definitive outcome, the different types of questions they both asked triggered me to think about what kind of personality type they would be, so I started wondering how personality types are related to development&#8230;.</p>
<h2>First things first: MBTI</h2>
<p>Before we can determine the effect of your personality on your development, we will start by defining MBTI, so let us begin with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator">the wikipedia definition</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) assessment is a psychometric questionnaire designed to measure psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They do this by categorizing your personality in four dimensions; your gradation in every dimension is not a boolean, but rather a range (i.e. -1 to +1).</p>
<p>I will describe each of the four dimensions in detail, and explain how they impact your development:</p>
<h2>#1 Attitude: &#8220;Extraversion&#8221; versus &#8220;Intraversion&#8221; (E vs I)</h2>
<p>Attitude is about the way evolve an idea and get inspired: some get inspired by doing and experimenting, while others get inspired by thinking about things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Development by people with high &#8220;Extraversion&#8221; is driven by    
<ul>
<li>experimenting with code</li>
<li>evolving ideas in small incremental steps by talking with other people</li>
<li>doing things right</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Development by people with high &#8220;Intraversion&#8221; is driven by    
<ul>
<li>an internal thought process</li>
<li>thinking ideas through before talking about it with other people</li>
<li>doing the right thing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On a sidenote, &#8220;extraversion&#8221; is not a typo; it is the way you spell this word in MBTI terms.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>#2 Percieving: &#8220;Sensing&#8221; versus &#8220;iNtuition&#8221; (S vs N)</h2>
<p>The second dimension is about how we percieve things&#8230; Some need to see the details (sensing), other  just have a general sense (i.e. intuition) of what it is supposed to do. This has obviously a rather big impact in the way that we write code&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Development by people with high sensing is usually explicit    
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Hmmz I need to know all the ins and outs before I use this, how does this tiny bit work?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Always use explicit typing everywhere, no exceptions!!&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;This looks dirty, I need to change this&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Coding without conventions? Always use the &#8216;private&#8217; keyword, even though it is implicit&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Development by people with high iNtuition is usually implicit    
<ul>
<li>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care how it works, when it is important to know I will find it out&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;dynamic and var are my friends&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I will refactor it when it hurts&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Ok, I will follow the coding conventions if you really force me&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>#3 Judging: &#8220;Thinking&#8221; versus &#8220;Feeling&#8221; (T vs F)</h2>
<p>I quite honestly have not met a single developer who was a &#8220;feeling&#8221; type; every single one I met was a rational type (which is kind of a logical thing - pun intended).</p>
<p>A lot of recruiters on the other hand, are usually a &#8220;feeling&#8221; type, hence this is probably a part of the problem I stated in <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Fallacies-of-the-tech-recruitment-process.aspx">one of my previous blog posts</a>.</p>
<h2>#4 Lifestyle: &#8220;judging&#8221; versus &#8220;perceiving&#8221; (J vs P)</h2>
<p>The final one is about which one of #2 and #3 you use the most to interact with the world: your &#8220;judging&#8221; or your &#8220;percieving part&#8221;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Development by a &#8220;judging&#8221; developer    
<ul>
<li>usually driven by a detailed plan</li>
<li>not deadline-driven </li>
<li>tends to be quite rigid when executing something, sometimes to rigid</li>
<li>works first, plays later</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Development by a &#8220;perceiving&#8221; developer    
<ul>
<li>driven by external impulses (Sensing or iNtuition)</li>
<li>deadline-driven</li>
<li>likes to keep his/her options open, sometimes indecisive</li>
<li>works in bursts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>So how is this related to the assesment ?</h2>
<p>When having an interview, it usually helps if the interviewer&#8217;s personality matches the interviewee&#8217;s as much as possible&#8230; There are compatibility matrices available for MBTI types which also mention opposites (f.e. my wife is my MBTI opposite), but I think this is not an advantage when doing an interview.</p>
<p>As an ENTP myself, I met two interviewers, and based on their questions I would guess that the first interviewer was an ISTP and the second one an INTP. (Not sure about the first letter, as interviewers tend to be intraverted during an interview.)</p>
<p>It does not take a genious to find out in which interview I performed best&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Update: I got pinged by both an INFP and an INFJ, so apparently the F part is still there for some developers. Next to this I misjudged my interviewers; they are ISTJ and ESTJ.. My bad!!! (but in my defense, the second one still matches my profile better then the first one&#8230;.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>I also received some food for thought from Rob Ashton:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="nl">
<p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/tojans">tojans</a> don&#8217;t think I agree with I/E - I think N/S is the biggest factor for dev, followed by J/P and I/E is about how you interact</p>
&mdash; &#8216;Hurricane Rob&#8217; (@RobAshton) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobAshton/status/269714326934396928">november 17, 2012</a></blockquote>
<p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Finally</h2>
<p>If you are a developer, this should give you a general idea of the MBTI type you are exactly. If you really want to find out, there is a short free questionaire online to determine your MBTI type <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp">here</a>.</p>
<p>On a sidenote, it would be great if the interviewers would be willing to send me a message whether I am correct or not with my guesstimate&#8230;</p>
<p>Signing off,</p>

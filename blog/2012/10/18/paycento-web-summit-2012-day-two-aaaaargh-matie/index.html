	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name">Paycento Web Summit 2012 - Day Two: Aaaaargh Matie</h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This is a follow-up post to <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Paycento-websummit-2012-Is-gra-liom-Eire.aspx">the post from yesterday</a>. While the first day was really nice, the second day was completely different.</p>
<h3>Meeting people</h3>
<p>After a good night of sleep and some breakfast at our AirBnb host, Geert and I got back to the venue. As this was our second day, we seemed to have less challenges handling the Irish traffic in our &#8220;Fiat Cinquecento&#8221;. As we arrived there, we met up with Pieter again we had a small chat about the event he had the night before, had some coffee and a small breakfast (I love the catering at Web Summit), finished some things I had to do on my laptop, and started socializing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>First things first; as Geert introduced me to the guys from <a href="http://8thcolor.com/" target="_blank">8thcolor </a>yesterday - another Belgian start-up -, I decided to go and see what<a href="http://asksybil.com/" target="_blank"> their product &#8220;asksybil&#8221;</a>actually was like. Christophe and Martin gave me a short demo about their product, and I was really amazed: by analyzing your source code commits, they actually make a smart estimate about the experience of a certain developer with a certain tech stack. They then use this data to determine your liabalility on this dependency, and even estimate your risk exposre by looking whether some knowledge is only known by a single person.</p>
<p>By talking with them, I realized I might have a potential lead for them, so I will try to introduce them in the next week into this company.</p>
<p>We also had some great discussions about possible evolutions/alternate paths one could follow with this product; and we decided to keep in touch. I really think this is a product to watch out for&#8230;</p>
<p>Another product I have seen was <a href="http://www.birdbox.com" target="_blank">Birdbox</a>: this is like a tool that aggregates all your pictures and videos over all social networks/sites/&#8230; I am definately going to try the beta of this. As we met over lunch I also told him about another startup idea I had, which in the end seemed to be similar, but not exactly the same; maybe it is still a potential case for my<a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Project-Startup10-Learning-to-build-your-own-business.aspx"> #Startup10 project</a>.</p>
<p>We also met a lot of other people who were actually really interested in building a business relationship with Paycento, so we did achieve what we wanted to achieve on this venue.</p>
<h3>The end is near</h3>
<p>Near the end of the last day, we met the guys from <a href="http://bubobox.com/" target="_blank">BuboBox</a>, another Belgian start-up who walked a path comparable to Paycento. As the venue was closing down, we decided to have a few drinks with them at the pub across the street, and I have to say I had quite some interesting discussions with both of the founders. After Pieter and Geert finished talking to the founder of <a href="http://9gag.com/" target="_blank">9Gag </a>we all regroupeed and had a few beers, but mostly a good chat talking about start-ups, persistence and life in general. (On a sidenote, I also found out one of them actually did read at least one of my blog posts -<a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Epilogue-One-night-in-Paris-CQRS-beers-and-life-in-general.aspx"> the one about the trip to Paris</a> -, which is always great to hear&#8230;)</p>
<p>I also noticed on twitter both <a href="https://twitter.com/RobAshton" target="_blank">@RobAshton</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/GraemeF" target="_blank">@GraemeF</a> were in Dublin for<a href="http://www.nodedublin.com/" target="_blank"> a node conference</a>, but unfortunately we failed to meetup this time&#8230;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/robashton">robashton</a> @<a href="https://twitter.com/graemef">graemef</a> ok; still at the same pub.. another time; enjoy!!!</p>

<h3>Finally, in closing</h3>
<p>&#8230; we decided to have dinner at an Italian restaurant close to the venue, to discuss the Web Summit, start-ups and Paycento. It was a great evening, and we gained some valuable insights, but also had lots of fun during dinner.</p>
<p>Finally, we headed back to our car, and arrived back at our AirBnb, where we said goodbye to our hostesses, thanking them for their hospitality with some Belgian beer.</p>
<p>So, that is it; Web Summit is gone.</p>
<p>As we have to get up within a few hours, and I still have some other things to do, I will end this post with a quote from Sun Tzu - The art of war:</p>
<p>&#8220;Opportunities multiply as they are seized&#8221;</p>
<p>Good night,</p>
<p>Tom</p></div>
